# Abstract

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting reliably improves large language model
performance on mathematical and symbolic reasoning, but recent work
shows that extending CoT degrades performance on planning, contested
ethical reasoning, and other tasks where the model lacks a reliable
internal verifier. Literature documents both effects without a
principled account of which property governs which side a given item
falls on.

We argue that *meta-uncertainty about the precision of one’s own
evidence* is a governing property. We prove that the variational policy
minimizing expected free energy under uncertain precision truncates cue
integration after a finite number $k^{*}$ of high-validity cues whenever
the precision prior has heavy enough tails (Theorem 2.6.1), and that
under a Descending Dominance condition the truncated policy is
sample-wise identical to Gigerenzer’s take-the-best heuristic (Theorem
2.7.4). Fast-and-frugal heuristics and active inference are, in the
meta-uncertain regime, two descriptions of the same computation.

This equivalence makes a sharp, falsifiable prediction about LLM
behavior: on items in the high-meta-uncertainty regime, extending CoT
should degrade rather than improve answer quality. We operationalize the
regime with a per-item score (cross-prompt variance, cross-seed
variance, and calibration error) validated by simulate-and-recover
($\rho > 0.96$), introduce **FEH-79**, a benchmark of Knightian frames
across four operational categories (non-recurrent forecasting,
novel-synthetic, open-ended dilemmas, strategic uncertainty) with
matched confound controls, and run a pre-registered confirmatory study
over seven models (five open-weight, 3B–32B, and two frontier systems),
five CoT-length conditions, and 7,875 responses. The registered primary
contrast is the randomly assigned reasoning length, and the decision
gate requires that the interaction $\beta_{3} < 0$ at a posterior
probability above 0.95, together with a robust implied accuracy drop of
more than 6 percentage points.

The prediction held. The interaction is negative at the posterior
probability $1.00$, with a posterior-median high-regime accuracy drop of
$17.3$ percentage points (95% credible interval
$\lbrack 7.7,25.5\rbrack$), clearing the pre-registered gate; matched
control items with definite answers show no such cost. The effect is not
universal, and we do not present it as such: it is decisive in the
capable mid-to-large models, directional in the two frontier systems,
and absent-to-reversed in the two weakest, exactly the regime-dependent
texture the theory predicts.

The framework gives a principled answer to “when should we use
chain-of-thought?” and unifies the Bayesian rational-analysis and
fast-and-frugal traditions: less-is-more effects are evidence about the
meta-uncertainty regime, not against Bayesian cognition.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 A puzzle

Consider two questions you might pose to a modern large language model.

The first: *What is 47 × 83?* If the model answers directly, it may err.
If you ask it to “think step by step,” it reliably gets 3,901. If you
let it reason at length, considering multiple angles, it still arrives
at 3,901. The reasoning chain extends, and the answer either improves or
remains the same.

The second: *A hospital ICU has one ventilator and two patients with
identical clinical profiles. Patient A is a 35-year-old single parent;
patient B is a 65-year-old senior physician. What is the most ethically
defensible decision procedure?* If the model answers directly, it states
some position; perhaps “random allocation.” If you ask it to reason in
three brief steps, it surfaces the utilitarian-vs-deontological framing
and commits to a position with explicit justification. If you let it
reason for fifteen steps, considering multiple angles, something
different happens: the chain frequently extends past the point where
additional reasoning carries information, hedges shift between framings,
and the resulting position is sometimes less coherent than the
three-step version.

The first item is a question with a settled answer. The second is not.
Both are well-formed prompts that contemporary models will produce
something from. But the function from “amount of reasoning” to “quality
of answer” is qualitatively different. On the first, more reasoning is
monotonically helpful or neutral. On the second, there is a window in
which a short chain of thought adds structure and an extended region in
which additional reasoning starts to subtract from coherence rather than
add to it.

This paper is about why that asymmetry exists, when it should appear,
and what it predicts about an entire class of questions on which
language models are increasingly being deployed.

## 1.2 The chain-of-thought contradiction

Chain-of-thought prompting has become one of the most reliable tools in
the applied LLM toolkit. The original demonstrations (Wei et al., 2022;
Kojima et al., 2022) showed that asking a model to articulate its
reasoning before committing to a final answer substantially improves
performance on multi-step arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and
symbolic manipulation. The result generalized across model families and
quickly became standard practice.

A counter-current followed. Sprague et al. (2024) found that the gains
from CoT are concentrated in mathematical and symbolic tasks; on most
other benchmarks, the lift is small or absent. Stechly et al. (2024)
showed that on planning tasks where the model lacks a verifier,
additional reasoning steps degrade rather than improve performance. Work
on CoT faithfulness has shown that the reasoning chain a model produces
is often not the chain from which its answer was actually derived
(Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023). And in adversarial
conditions (questions where prior beliefs and reasoning conflict),
extended reasoning has been shown to amplify rather than correct biases.

Two empirical observations, both well-replicated, sit side by side: more
reasoning helps on some tasks and hurts on others. The literature has
catalogued examples on both sides but lacks a principled account of
*what task property* governs which side a given item falls on. Without
such an account, every new task category requires a fresh empirical
check and prompting practice defaults to “use CoT unless someone proves
it hurts”; a reasonable heuristic in the absence of theory but not a
satisfying scientific position.

The conjecture this paper advances is that there is a single underlying
property, meta-uncertainty about the precision of one’s own evidence,
that governs whether additional reasoning helps. When meta-uncertainty
is low (the cue values you would compute are reliable), more reasoning
is helpful. When meta-uncertainty is high (you cannot tell which of your
candidate inferences are well-grounded), additional reasoning becomes a
source of noise rather than a source of signal. The optimal policy is to
commit early to whatever your first one or two reasoning steps deliver.
The asymmetry between the multiplication problem and the triage problem
is the asymmetry between low-meta-uncertainty and high-meta-uncertainty
regimes.

## 1.3 An old framework, a new test bed

The claim that more deliberation is sometimes worse than less is not
new. Gerd Gigerenzer and his collaborators (Gigerenzer & Goldstein,
1996; Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009) have spent three decades documenting
*less-is-more effects* in human judgment: simple heuristics such as
take-the-best, tallying, recognition, that ignore most of the available
information and that, on a wide range of inference problems, match or
beat strategies that use all the cues. The fast-and-frugal program is
the most thorough catalog of less-is-more effects in cognitive science.

The fast-and-frugal program has had an awkward relationship with the
rational-analysis tradition (Anderson, 1991; Oaksford & Chater, 2007;
Lieder & Griffiths, 2020), which treats cognition as approximate
Bayesian inference. Bayesian models, taken literally, predict that
incorporating more evidence cannot hurt: more cues should never reduce
posterior accuracy. Empirical less-is-more effects are then read either
as evidence against Bayesian cognition or as artifacts of resource
constraints. The two literatures have largely argued past each other.

This paper argues that the disagreement dissolves once meta-uncertainty
is incorporated into the model. A Bayesian agent whose own precision is
uncertain, who does not know how reliable her cue weights are, has a
*rational* incentive to truncate cue integration after a small number of
high-validity cues. The cue-truncation theorem (Theorem 2.6.1) shows
that the optimal stopping point $k^{*}$ is finite whenever the precision
prior has heavy enough tails, and that under stronger conditions (the
Descending Dominance condition of Appendix A.4) the truncated policy is
sample-wise identical to Gigerenzer’s take-the-best. Heuristics and
active inference are, in this regime, two descriptions of the same
computation.

The framework is general; it speaks to any agent operating under
meta-uncertain precision. But large language models are an unusually
clean empirical test bed. Their reasoning is externalized as text; the
“number of cues integrated” is the number of reasoning steps in the
chain of thought, which can be directly manipulated by specifying prompt
length. The latent regime, whether the agent is in a high- or
low-meta-uncertainty state, is approximated by behavioural signatures
(cross-prompt variance, cross-seed variance, calibration error) that are
also directly measurable from the model. The theoretical equivalence
makes a sharp prediction about LLM behavior: on items where the regime
score is high, extending the chain of thought should *degrade* answer
quality, even though on items where the regime score is low, extending
it should improve or preserve quality. That prediction is the empirical
core of this paper.

## 1.4 The prediction

The prediction takes the form of an interaction effect in a hierarchical
model. For each (model, item) cell, we measure accuracy under five
chain-of-thought length conditions: no CoT, \~3 steps, \~7 steps, \~15
steps, and unconstrained. The high-meta-uncertainty regime is
operationalized by item category, the Knightian frames of FEH-79 against
matched controls, an assignment backed by the falsifiable construction
criteria of §4 (§3 develops the continuous regime score the categories
instantiate). The registered primary contrast is the randomly assigned
reasoning length, not the realized step count, which is endogenous (§6).
We then fit:

$$\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot \text{steps}_{ij} + \beta_{2} \cdot \text{regime}_{i} + \beta_{3} \cdot (\text{steps}_{ij} \times \text{regime}_{i}) + \alpha_{m(ij)} + \gamma_{m(ij)} \cdot \text{steps}_{ij} + u_{i}$$

The registered confirmatory gate requires the interaction
$\beta_{3} < 0$ at posterior probability above 0.95 together with a
robust implied high-regime accuracy drop above six percentage points;
the opposite direction, $\beta_{3} > 0$ at posterior probability above
0.95, falsifies the theory. The original full-reversal statistic
$|\beta_{3}| > |\beta_{1}|$ is retained as a reported effect size rather
than a gate. The hypothesis, the gate, and the deviation protocol were
pre-registered and amended before data collection (Chapter 6), and the
outcome is reported in Chapter 7.

The benchmark on which the prediction is tested is FEH-79: a 79-frame
item pool spanning four operational categories of Knightian uncertainty
(non-recurrent forecasting, novel-synthetic scenarios, open-ended
dilemmas, and strategic uncertainty) together with three
confound-control sets (50 reference, aleatory, and calibration-probe
items). The benchmark construction protocol (Chapter 4) follows the
operational criteria in §4.3 to ensure that meta-uncertainty, rather
than computational difficulty or training-data contamination, is the
property that distinguishes Knightian from control items.

## 1.5 Contributions

This paper makes five contributions:

1.  **Equivalence theorem (Chapter 2).** Under uncertain precision, the
    variational policy that minimizes expected free energy is equivalent
    to the cue-integration policies of the fast-and-frugal heuristics
    program for a non-empty regime of meta-uncertainty. Theorem 2.6.1
    (cue-truncation) gives the existence result; Theorem 2.7.4
    (Descending Dominance) gives the sample-wise identity with
    take-the-best.

2.  **Operationalization (Chapter 3).** A measurement procedure that
    maps the theoretical “high-meta-uncertainty regime” to behavioral
    signatures observable from an LLM, with a simulate-and-recover
    validation showing that the regime score recovers the underlying
    precision prior parameter ($\rho > 0.96$ for the
    prompt-and-seed-variance composite).

3.  **Benchmark (Chapter 4).** FEH-79: 79 Knightian frames spanning four
    operational categories, plus 50 controls; an item-construction
    protocol that distinguishes meta-uncertainty from difficulty; and a
    step-counting pipeline that converts arbitrary CoT responses into a
    comparable cue count.

4.  **Pre-registered empirical study (confirmed).** A confirmatory test
    of the regime-dependent prediction across a seven-model panel (five
    open-weight models, 3B–32B, and two frontier systems), five
    chain-of-thought length conditions, and five replications per cell.
    Pre-registration locked in the hypothesis thresholds, the
    falsification criteria, and the robustness battery before data
    collection; the registered interaction was negative at a posterior
    probability of 1.00, with a 17.3-point drop in high-regime accuracy
    (Chapter 7).

5.  **Theoretical resolution.** A unified account of when less-is-more
    effects should appear in inference under uncertainty, applicable to
    human and machine reasoners. The framework treats rational-analysis
    and fast-and-frugal traditions as describing the same computation in
    different meta-uncertainty regimes, rather than as rival accounts.

## 1.6 Why this matters

The contribution lands in three places at once.

*Practically*, the framework gives an answer to “when should we use
chain-of-thought?” that is more useful than “always” or “it depends.” If
the regime score of a task can be measured before deployment, the
optimal CoT policy can be chosen. For high-meta-uncertainty tasks such
as most policy forecasts, contested ethical decisions, novel-scenario
judgments, and strategic interactions with unknown counterparties, the
policy is to truncate. For low-meta-uncertainty tasks — calibrated
technical reasoning, well-specified mathematical problems, problems with
verifiable intermediate steps — the policy is to extend. Applied LLM
systems making this choice today rely on rules of thumb; the regime
score provides them with a principled measure.

*Theoretically*, the framework resolves a thirty-year tension between
the Bayesian rational-analysis tradition and the fast-and-frugal
heuristics program. Less-is-more effects are not evidence against
Bayesian cognition; they are evidence about which meta-uncertainty
regime an agent is in. Heuristics are not workarounds for resource
constraints; they are the rational policy under high meta uncertainty.
Both literatures keep their empirical results and their interpretive
frames; what changes is the relation between them.

*Methodologically*, the paper contributes a regime-aware approach to LLM
evaluation. Current benchmarking practice averages performance across
items as if all items were drawn from a single population; the U-shape
and monotonic regimes get smeared together. A regime-stratified analysis
reveals predictions that are otherwise invisible. The FEH-79 benchmark
and the step-counting pipeline are released with the paper as tools for
future regime-aware studies.

## 1.7 Roadmap

Chapter 2 (*Theoretical Foundation*) develops the active-inference
framework under uncertain precision, derives the cue-truncation theorem,
and establishes the sample-wise identity with take-the-best under the
Descending Dominance condition. Five appendices contain the closed-form
proofs and the verification scripts that reproduce each result
numerically.

Chapter 3 (*Operationalization*) maps the theoretical regime to an
empirical regime score computed from three behavioral signatures,
reports the simulate-and-recover validation that the score recovers the
underlying precision prior, and locks the falsifiable interaction
hypothesis used in the empirical study.

Chapter 4 (*Benchmark Design*) introduces the FEH-79 item pool, the four
operational categories of Knightian uncertainty, the confound-control
sets, and the construction protocol that distinguishes meta-uncertainty
from computational difficulty.

Chapter 5 (*Methods*) gives the executed design: the seven-model panel,
the 45-item subset of FEH-79 used in the confirmatory run, the
five-condition reasoning-length ladder, the scoring pipeline, and an
account of where the run departed from the letter of the
pre-registration.

Chapter 6 (*Pre-Registered Analysis Plan*) reproduces the analysis fixed
before the data existed: the hierarchical Bayesian model, the decision
gate, the falsification rule, the secondary realized-steps analysis, and
the robustness battery.

Chapter 7 (*Results*) reports the confirmatory outcome: the descriptive
signature, the primary interaction, the per-model heterogeneity, the
realized-steps reversal and its resolution, the controls, the robustness
checks, and convergence.

Chapter 8 (*Discussion*) places the finding in context, states what the
confirmation licenses and what it does not, develops the limitations and
the future work agenda, and draws out the implications for applied LLM
systems, cognitive science, and AI under meta-uncertainty.

The pre-registration document, the FEH-79 item pool, the step-counting
pipeline, and the verification scripts for all theorems are released
alongside the paper.

# Chapter 2: Theoretical Foundation

## §2.0 The Problem and the Proposal in Plain Language

Contemporary artificial intelligence has bet on a single proposition:
that more inference produces better decisions. The bet appears in many
forms, such as chain-of-thought prompting, multi-step deliberation,
test-time compute scaling, mixture-of-experts deep reasoning, and the
broader family of inference-heavy architectures that dominate the
current frontier. Behind all of them sits a Laplacean assumption: that
an agent in possession of more reasoning capacity is, ceteris paribus,
an agent that decides better.

This paper argues that the Laplacean assumption is wrong in a specific,
identifiable, and consequential regime. Under uncertainty about the
reliability of one's own prior beliefs (a condition we will define
precisely as meta-uncertainty), additional inference is not merely
wasteful but actively harmful: it systematically increases expected free
energy, makes the agent more confidently wrong, and produces decisions
strictly worse than those an agent applying a much simpler procedure
would produce. The simpler procedure, we will show, is structurally
equivalent to the family of fast-and-frugal heuristics characterized by
Gigerenzer and colleagues. The paper's title states the operational
consequence: under genuine uncertainty, reasoning hurts, and the
corrective is a precision-aware heuristic architecture.

#### Levels of uncertainty: vocabulary

The argument depends on distinctions that are routinely collapsed in the
AI literature. We make them explicit on the first page.

**Risk** denotes uncertainty over outcomes whose probabilities are
known. A fair die, a calibrated weather model, a well-specified
portfolio: these are risky but not uncertain in the sense we use the
term. Standard Bayesian decision theory fully accounts for risk.

**Ambiguity** denotes uncertainty about the probability distribution
itself. Under ambiguity, the agent cannot license a single precise prior
over outcomes; the prior is itself uncertain, contested, or
underdetermined. The classical formalization is Ellsberg's two-urn
paradox (Ellsberg, 1961), which demonstrates that agents systematically
distinguish ambiguity from risk in ways that violate the Savage axioms.

**Knightian uncertainty**, following Knight (1921), denotes the broadest
category in which probabilistic measurement is not licensed at all.
Knight's original sense is stronger than modern ambiguity: it denies
that any single precise probability distribution can be specified, not
merely that the agent is uncertain among several. Modern formalizations
include the maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) and
the smooth ambiguity model of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005,
hereafter KMM).

**Meta-uncertainty**, as we use the term, denotes uncertainty about the
reliability of an agent's own prior commitments. Formally,
meta-uncertainty is captured by introducing a precision parameter
governing the prior over a random variable with its own prior
distribution. This is the technical operationalization developed in
§§2.3–2.7.

> **Scope claim and honest delimitation.** FEH operationalizes *one
> tractable species* of genuine uncertainty: meta-uncertainty over prior
> precision. This species sits inside the broader KMM smooth-ambiguity
> framework as a particular choice of second-order distribution, and
> inside the broader Knightian category as a measurable subclass. We do
> not claim that meta-uncertainty exhausts Knightian indeterminacy. We
> claim something more specific and more useful: that meta-uncertainty
> is the species of genuine uncertainty present in contemporary
> inference systems (human, biological, and artificial), and that under
> this species, the headline claim of the paper (additional inference
> systematically hurts) can be derived as a theorem rather than asserted
> as hope.

#### The KMM bridge

The smooth ambiguity model of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005)
provides the natural decision-theoretic framing for what FEH will
formalize. KMM separates the agent's first-order probability
distribution over states from a second-order distribution over plausible
first-order distributions and characterizes the ambiguity attitude as a
function φ applied to the expected utilities under each first-order
distribution. Concave φ encodes ambiguity aversion; linear φ recovers
subjective expected utility under the marginal first-order distribution.

FEH inherits this two-level structure with a specific commitment: the
second-order distribution is taken to be over a precision parameter
governing prior strength, rather than over arbitrary aspects of the
prior. This is a substantive modeling choice, narrower than KMM's
general framework, but computationally tractable and empirically
operationalizable. KMM and FEH share a common motivation: both treat the
agent as uncertain about its first-order distribution and both produce
decision criteria richer than standard subjective expected utility, but
they differ structurally in what they penalize. KMM penalizes variance
in expected utility across the second-order distribution; FEH penalizes
commitment in the meta-precision posterior as cues accumulate. The two
frameworks are complementary rather than equivalent (we return to this
point in §2.8).

#### The proposal in plain language

Stripped of formalism, the proposal is this. Suppose an inference agent
is uncertain not only about the state of the world, but about how much
weight to place on its own prior beliefs. Then each additional cue the
agent integrates carries two contributions to its expected free energy.
The first contribution is positive: the agent learns something about the
world. The second contribution is negative: the agent commits more
strongly to a particular posterior over its own prior reliability, and
that commitment carries an explicit cost in expected free energy that
grows with the number of cues integrated.

In the standard low-meta-uncertainty regime, the first contribution
dominates and full Bayesian inference is optimal. In the
high-meta-uncertainty regime, the second contribution begins to dominate
after a finite number of cues, at which point further cue integration
strictly increases expected free energy. The optimal policy in this
regime is to truncate cue integration at the crossover point, and the
optimal cue ordering at truncation, we will show, coincides with the
validity ordering used by take-the-best.

This recovers fast-and-frugal heuristics as the structural form of
optimal inference under metal uncertainty. Far from being departures
from rationality, heuristics in this regime are what rationality looks
like.

#### Three counterarguments, named upfront

Three objections will arise from informed readers, and we name them now
so the rest of the chapter can address them in their proper places.

**Objection 1 (the hierarchical Bayes objection).** Hierarchical
Bayesian models with uncertain hyperparameters are well-established.
They do not, in general, produce heuristic-like policies. Why should we
use our framework? The answer is that FEH adds two conjunctive
ingredients that hierarchical Bayes alone does not supply: (a) the
explicit accounting of meta-precision divergence as a free-energy cost
in sequential cue integration, and (b) the evaluation of policies by
expected free energy rather than by expected utility under the marginal
posterior. The combination of these ingredients with hierarchical Bayes
is what produces the cue-truncation result. Hierarchical Bayes alone
does not.

**Objection 2 (the resource-rational objection).** Resource-rational
analysis (Lieder and Griffiths, 2020) and the broader
computational-rationality program already explain why bounded
computation can justify simple heuristics. What does FEH add? The answer
is that resource-rationality treats computation as a finite budget the
agent allocates against expected utility gain; the cost of complex
computation justifies the cost of simple policies. FEH adds a
substantively different cost channel: an **epistemic** cost (the
meta-precision divergence) that exists *even with unlimited
computation*. Under meta-uncertainty, the optimal policy is
heuristic-shaped not because computation is expensive, but because
additional inference is epistemically counterproductive. FEH and
resource-rationality are complementary accounts, not competitors; both
can apply simultaneously, with different signatures.

**Objection 3 (the empirical mixed-results objection).** Less-is-more
effects are real but not universal, and the take-the-best literature has
produced mixed empirical results. Doesn't this undercut the framework?
The answer is that this is exactly what FEH predicts. The cue-truncation
theorem holds in the meta-uncertainty regime *σ²_τ \> τ_regime*; outside
this regime, full Bayesian integration is optimal. The empirical
heterogeneity of less-is-more findings is consistent with
regime-conditional theory, and FEH provides a path to discriminating it
from theories predicting universal less-is-more (which the literature
does not support) or universal more-is-more (which the literature also
does not support).

#### Roadmap for §2

The rest of §2 develops the theory in seven moves. §2.1 introduces a
discrete binary toy model in which the cue-truncation result is
intuitive and motivates the rest of the formalism. §2.2 generalizes
notation and the generative model. §2.3 promotes the prior precision to
a random variable. §2.4 derives the sequential inference machinery and
the accumulating meta-precision divergence. §2.5 decomposes the expected
free energy into information-gain and meta-precision-cost terms. §2.6
states and proves the cue-truncation theorem. §2.7 establishes
structural equivalence to take-the-best. §2.8 positions FEH against the
major adjacent frameworks. §2.9 situates the framework within the source
disciplines of Friston and Gigerenzer. §2.10 enumerates open
mathematical questions for follow-up work.

## §2.1 The Binary Toy Model

Before introducing the continuous formalism that powers the rest of the
chapter, we develop the central intuition in the discrete binary setting
that motivates take-the-best. The binary toy model is not a special case
of the Gaussian-Gamma model that follows; it is a parallel construction
that exhibits the same cue-truncation behavior under meta-uncertainty.
Its function in the chapter is pedagogical: it shows that the FEH effect
is not an artifact of Gaussian assumptions but rather reflects a
structural feature of sequential inference under uncertain priors.

#### Setup

Consider a binary choice problem with a latent state $s \in 0,1$. We may
interpret $s\  = \ 1$ as the proposition "option A is better than option
B" in a comparative judgment task. The agent observes a sequence of
binary cues $c_{1},c_{2},\ldots,c_{K} \in 0,1$ drawn in some order. Each
cue $c_{j}$ is informative about *s* through its **cue validity** in the
Gigerenzer–Goldstein sense:

$V_{j}\  = \ P(s\  = \ 1\ |\ c_{j}\  = \ 1)$ (2.1.1)

In the empirical literature (Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer,
Todd, and the ABC Research Group, 1999), validity is operationalized
over a reference environment of judgment trials as:

$v_{j} = N_{c}orrect\text{/}\left( N_{c}orrect + N_{i}ncorrect \right)$
(2.1.2)

where $N_{c}orrect$ and $N_{i}ncorrect$ count, respectively, the trials
in which the cue $j$ discriminates correctly and incorrectly between the
two options. Validity is an environmental property: it characterizes the
local predictive value of a cue $j$ in the ecology in which the agent
must decide. This is distinct from ecological rationality, which
characterizes the higher-level fit between an agent's strategy and its
environment. The two should not be conflated.

#### Prior over the binary state and its meta-uncertainty

Let the agent's prior over the binary state be parameterized by a
probability $p_{0} \in (0,1)$ so that
$P(s\  = \ 1\ |\ p\_ 0)\  = \ p\_ 0$. In standard Bayesian treatments,
$p_{0}$ is fixed. The FEH generalization promotes $p_{0}$ to a random
variable with a prior distribution

$p_{0} \sim Beta\left( \alpha_{0},\beta_{0} \right)$ (2.1.3)

with mean
$\mu_{0} = \alpha_{0}\text{/}\left( \alpha_{0} + \beta_{0} \right)$ and
concentration $\kappa_{0} = \alpha_{0} + \beta_{0}$. The concentration
$\kappa_{0}$ is the binary analogue of precision: large $\kappa_{0}$
corresponds to a tightly concentrated prior, small $\kappa_{0}$ - to
substantial meta-uncertainty about $p_{0}$.

> **Definition 2.1.1 (binary meta-uncertainty regime).** In the binary
> toy model, the agent is in the **meta-uncertainty regime** when the
> concentration $\kappa_{0}$ of the hyperprior on $p_{0}$ is small
> relative to the cue budget $K$. Operationally, the regime is
> characterized by the agent updating its posterior over $p_{0}$
> substantially over the course of cue integration, meaning the agent
> learns about its own prior reliability *from the cues themselves*, and
> this learning carries a divergence cost.

#### Sequential cue integration with meta-uncertainty

Under the standard Bayesian update (no meta-uncertainty), the posterior
on s after observing cues $c_{1}:k$ factorizes cleanly:

$P\left( s = 1|c_{1};k,p_{0} \right) \propto p_{0} \cdot \prod_{j}^{}L_{j}\left( c_{j} \right)$
(2.1.4)

where
$L_{j}\left( c_{j} \right) = v_{j}^{c_{j}}\left( 1 - v_{j} \right)^{1 - c_{j}}$
if $s\  = \ 1$ and the corresponding switched form if $s\  = \ 0$, under
a symmetric error model on cue likelihoods.

Under meta-uncertainty, the agent must marginalize over the hyperprior
on $p_{0}$:

$P(s\  = \ 1\ |\ c_{1}:k)\  = \ \int\ P(s\  = \ 1\ |\ c_{1};k,\ p_{0})\  \cdot \ p(p_{0}\ |\ c_{1};k)\ {dp}_{0}$
(2.1.5)

Critically, the hyperprior itself updates with each cue: the cues are
indirect evidence about $p_{0}$, because they jointly constrain which
values of $p_{0}$ are consistent with the observed cue pattern. Let
$p\left( p_{0} \middle| c_{1}:k \right)$ denote the updated hyperprior
after $k$ cues. The KL divergence of this updated hyperprior from the
original is the binary analogue of the meta-precision divergence
introduced in §2.4:

$\Delta_{m}eta(k) = KL\lbrack p\left( p_{0} \middle| c_{1}:k \right)\left. \parallel p\left( p_{0} \right) \right\rbrack$

The proof is by martingale-convexity of KL: the variational posterior
$p(p_{0} \mid c_{1:k + 1})$ is a martingale in $k$ (its conditional
expectation given $c_{1:k}$ equals $p(p_{0} \mid c_{1:k})$), and the KL
divergence from a fixed reference distribution is convex in its first
argument, so Jensen’s inequality applies. Detailed proof is given in
Appendix A.1.

#### The intuition behind cue truncation, in binary form

With Lemma 2.1.2 in hand, the cue-truncation intuition becomes
transparent. Each cue contributes two things to the expected free
energy:

**(i)** A **positive** *expected* information gain
$E\lbrack I(k)\rbrack \geq 0$, the reduction in entropy of the posterior
over $s$, which is the largest for the most valid cue and decreases by
diminishing returns as more cues are integrated.

**(ii)** A **negative** *expected* meta-divergence increment
$E\lbrack C(k)\rbrack = E\lbrack\Delta_{meta}(k)\rbrack - E\lbrack\Delta_{meta}(k - 1)\rbrack \geq 0$,
the divergence accumulated in expectation by becoming more committed to
a particular posterior over the agent’s own prior reliability.

In the binary case, the most valid discriminating cue typically produces
a posterior over $s$ that is already concentrated near 0 or 1. The
marginal information gain from a second discriminating cue is therefore
small; it can only sharpen an already-sharp posterior. Meanwhile, the
meta-divergence cost $E\lbrack C(k)\rbrack$ is bounded below by a
non-zero quantity proportional to the inverse hyperprior concentration.
The crossover point $k^{*}$, beyond which
$E\lbrack I(k)\rbrack < E\lbrack C(k)\rbrack$ and integrating further
cues strictly increases expected free energy, exists generically.

The intermediate one-cue regime $\lbrack\kappa_{lo},\kappa_{hi}\rbrack$
is closed and may be narrow. Numerical sweep over 1875 parameter
combinations finds 40 with strict $k^{*} = 1$ (Appendix A.1, §A.1.5);
these cluster around steep validity gradients (e.g.,
$v_{1} \approx 0.99,v_{j > 1} \leq 0.55$) and $\kappa_{0} \approx 1$.
For uniform-validity profiles, $\kappa_{lo} = \kappa_{hi}$ and the
transition jumps directly from $k^{*} = 0$ to $k^{*} = K$ without an
intermediate regime. The narrowness of the one-cue regime in the binary
toy model is a substantive finding; the cue-truncation theorem fires at
the *boundary* between regimes in the binary case, not as a wide
intermediate band.

A subsidiary result (Appendix A.1, §A.1.5): for steep validity
gradients, the *first cue alone* contributes ≥99% of the total
attainable information about $s$ across the full cue budget. Even in
regimes where $k^{*} = K$ strictly minimizes EFE, a TTB-style “stop
after the first cue” policy is *near*-optimal in expected reward terms.
This near-optimality is the empirically-relevant content of the TTB
connection in the binary setting; the strict EFE-optimality in the
narrow $\lbrack\kappa_{lo},\kappa_{hi}\rbrack$ window is the
formally-derivable but operationally-fragile content. The cleaner and
more robust derivation of the TTB connection lives in §2.7 via the
Gaussian-Gamma machinery, which produces a wider intermediate
cue-truncation regime (Theorem 2.6.1 and Appendix A.3).

#### Why the binary model is not enough

The binary toy model motivates the FEH effect and establishes the
qualitative three-regime structure that the rest of the chapter
generalizes. It is not, however, sufficient for the chapter’s
load-bearing claims. Four reasons. First, real cognitive and
computational tasks rarely admit clean binary state spaces; the FEH
framework must handle continuous, high-dimensional latent variables.
Second, the binary case obscures the role of precision as a continuous
parameter; it is treated as a Beta concentration, which is closely
related but less naturally analyzed within the active-inference
framework that grounds the rest of the chapter. Third, the empirical
predictions for LLMs require a generative model that can be matched to
LLM behavior, which the Gaussian-Gamma machinery supports more directly.
Fourth, and most importantly, the strict cue-truncation regime
($k^{*} = 1$) is a knife-edge in the binary setting (Proposition 2.1.3
above): the cue-truncation theorem is robust as a wide intermediate
regime only in the continuous Gaussian-Gamma model of §§2.3–2.6.

For these reasons, the rest of §2 develops the continuous Gaussian-Gamma
formalism. The binary toy model should be read as motivating intuition
and a near-optimality argument for TTB; the strict TTB derivation lives
in §2.7 via the Gaussian-Gamma machinery, which is the analytical
workhorse and the load-bearing setting for the chapter’s main results.

## §2.2 Notation and General Generative Model

We now generalize from the binary toy model to a generative model
framework adequate for the rest of the chapter. The framework is the
standard active-inference framework of Friston (2010), Friston et al.
(2017), and Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston (2022), with the meta-uncertainty
extension developed in §2.3.

#### State, observation, cue, action

Let $s\  \in \ S$ denote the latent state, with $S$ a finite or compact
set. The binary case $S = 0,1$ of §2.1 is one specialization; we now
treat $S$ as arbitrary unless otherwise noted. The agent does not
observe $s$ directly. Cues $c_{1},\ldots,c_{K} \in C$ are informative
about $s$ through cue likelihoods
$p\left( c_{j} \middle| s,\tau_{c,j} \right)$, with cue-specific
precisions $\tau_{c,j}$ assumed to be known to the agent.

An outcome $o\  \in \ O$ is the consequence of action $a\  \in \ A$
given true state $s$, with likelihood $p(o\ |\ s,\ a)$. Actions are
evaluated using the expected free energy, as defined in §2.5.

#### Generative model

The active-inference generative model used throughout this chapter is

$p(o,\ s,\ c_{1:K},\ \tau\ |\ a)\  = \ p(o\ |\ s,\ a)\  \cdot \ p(s\ |\ \tau)\  \cdot \ p(\tau)\  \cdot \ \prod_{j = 1}^{K}\ p(c_{j}\ |\ s,\ \tau,\ \gamma_{j})$
(2.2.1)

with three commitments.

**(1) State prior with random precision.**
$p(s\ |\ \tau)\  = \ \mathcal{N(}s;\ \mu,\ \tau^{- 1}\Sigma_{0})$. The
shape matrix $\Sigma_{0}$ is fixed; the scalar $\tau\  > \ 0$ is the
agent’s **meta-precision**, a single random variable governing the
overall scale of inference confidence.

**(2) Cue likelihood with shared meta-precision and intrinsic scaling.**
Each cue is a noisy linear measurement of state:

$p(c_{j}\ |\ s,\ \tau,\ \gamma_{j})\  = \ \mathcal{N(}c_{j};\ A_{j}s,\ (\tau\,\gamma_{j})^{- 1}\, I_{d_{c}})$
(2.2.2)

where $A_{j}$ is the cue-to-state observation matrix and
$\gamma_{j}\  > \ 0$ is the **intrinsic precision** of cue $j$ ; a fixed
structural property of the cue, estimable from training-data statistics,
distinct from but related to the cue validity $v_{j}$ of §2.1.

**(3) Hyperprior over meta-precision.**
$p(\tau)\  = \ Gamma(\tau;\ \alpha_{0},\ \beta_{0})$, with
$E\lbrack\tau\rbrack\  = \ \tau_{0}\  = \ \alpha_{0}/\beta_{0}$ and
$Var\lbrack\tau\rbrack\  = \ \alpha_{0}/\beta_{0}^{2}\  = \ \tau_{0}^{2}/\alpha_{0}$.

The principal departures of FEH from the standard active-inference
framework lie in the second and third commitments. The standard
treatment fixes $\tau$ as a hyperparameter and treats cue precisions as
separate fixed quantities $\tau_{c,j}$. FEH ties cue precisions to the
meta-precision via $\tau\,\gamma_{j}$ and treats $\tau$ as a full random
variable. The intrinsic-precision factors $\gamma_{j}$ retain the
cue-specific structure of the standard model while making the agent’s
overall calibration uncertain in a single scalar parameter.

> **Interpretive remark.** The asymmetry that v0.2 acknowledged —
> “uncertain prior precision but known cue precisions” (cf. open
> question Q4 in v0.3) — dissolves under this specification. All
> precisions in the model share the meta-precision scale $\tau$;
> cue-specific structure lives in the deterministic intrinsic-precision
> factors $\gamma_{j}$. This is a more faithful operationalization of
> the meta-uncertainty story: the agent is uncertain about the overall
> reliability of its inference apparatus, not selectively about its
> prior. The intrinsic precisions $\gamma_{j}$ are properties of the
> cue, learnable from data; $\tau$ is the agent’s calibration
> confidence, which can be genuinely uncertain in novel contexts. §2.3
> develops the meta-precision generalization in detail.

#### Cue validity revisited

The cue validity $v_{j}$ defined in (2.1.1) generalizes to non-binary
states as the conditional probability that cue $c_{j}$ takes its
discriminating value given state $s$ in some reference partition of $S$.
For multi-class $S$, validity becomes a vector quantity, with one
component per state. For the rest of §2 we follow the binary convention
except where multi-class generalization is explicitly needed.

## §2.3 Meta-Uncertainty over Prior Precision

We now state the central generalization of the active-inference
framework that defines FEH. The conceptual content was previewed in
§2.0; this section formalizes it.

#### From fixed precision to random precision

Let the prior over latent states take the precision-modulated Gaussian
form

$p(s\ |\ \tau)\  = \ N(s\ ;\ \mu,\ \tau ⁻¹\ \Sigma_{0})$ (2.3.1)

with prior mean *μ* and fixed shape matrix $\Sigma_{0}$. Larger $\tau$
yields a tighter, more confident prior; the limit
$\tau\  \rightarrow \ \infty$ recovers a point prior at $\mu$, and
$\tau\  \rightarrow \ 0$ yields an essentially flat prior over the state
space.

In the standard active-inference treatment, τ is a fixed hyperparameter,
possibly modulated by attention or learned as a point estimate from
data. In FEH, τ is a random variable with prior

$p(\tau) = Gamma\left( \tau;\alpha_{0},\beta_{0} \right)$ (2.3.2)

so that
$E\lbrack\tau\rbrack = \alpha_{0}\text{/}\beta_{0} \equiv \tau_{0}andVar\lbrack\tau\rbrack = \alpha_{0}\text{/}\beta_{0}^{2} \equiv \sigma_{\tau}^{2}$.
The choice of Gamma is dictated by conjugacy with the Gaussian
likelihood in (2.3.1); other choices (log-normal, inverse-Gamma,
half-Cauchy) are considered as a sensitivity check in §2.10, Q2.

> **Definition 2.3.1 (continuous meta-uncertainty regime).** The agent
> operates in the **meta-uncertainty regime** when ${\sigma ²}_{\tau}$
> is non-negligible relative to $\tau_{0²}$. The precise threshold
> separating high and low meta-uncertainty is derived in §2.5.
> Heuristically, the regime corresponds to the agent being substantively
> uncertain about how much weight to place on its own prior, the
> continuous analogue of small Beta concentration in the binary toy
> model.

#### Marginal prior over states

Integrating τ out of the joint prior yields the marginal prior over
states:

$p(s)\  = \ \int\ p(s\ |\ \tau)\ p(\tau)\ d\tau$ (2.3.3)

For the conjugate Gaussian–Gamma pair (2.3.1)–(2.3.2), this integral
admits a closed form: the marginal $p(s)$ is a multivariate Student-t
distribution

$p(s) = St\left( s;\mu,\left( \beta_{0}\text{/}\alpha_{0} \right)\Sigma_{0},\nu = 2\alpha_{0} \right)$
(2.3.4)

with $\nu = 2\alpha_{0}$ degrees of freedom. As
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \rightarrow 0$ (equivalently
$\alpha_{0} \rightarrow \infty$ with $\tau_{0}$ held fixed), the
Student-$t$ collapses to a Gaussian $N(\mu,\ \tau_{0⁻¹}\ \Sigma_{0}))$,
recovering the fixed-precision case. For finite $\alpha_{0}$, the
marginal prior has heavier-than-Gaussian tails, a structural feature
that connects FEH to the broader power-law statistics characteristic of
natural cognition (see §2.9).

> **Connection to KMM smooth ambiguity.** Equation (2.3.2) is the FEH
> operationalization of the KMM second-order distribution. Where KMM
> treats the second-order distribution $\mu$ over first-order
> probability measures abstractly, FEH commits to $\mu$ being the Gamma
> distribution over a precision scalar. This is a substantive
> restriction of the KMM framework: not all ambiguity is
> precision-ambiguity, and FEH does not claim otherwise. The advantage
> is computational and empirical tractability; the cost is that some
> ambiguity phenomena fall outside the FEH operationalization. Whether
> the precision-ambiguity restriction is empirically adequate for the
> LLM regime is an open question we will return to in the empirical
> chapter.

## §2.4 Sequential Inference under Meta-Uncertainty

We now formalize the sequential cue-integration setting that supports
the cue-truncation theorem. The agent receives cues.
$c_{1},\ldots,c_{K}$ one at a time and updates a variational posterior
$q(s,\tau)$ after each cue. The question is: what is the total
free-energy cost of integrating k cues under meta-uncertainty, and how
does that cost decompose?

#### Variational factorization

Under the standard mean-field assumption, the variational posterior over
states and meta-precision factorizes:

$q(s,\tau) = q(s)q(\tau)$ (2.4.1)

This is an approximation. Its accuracy is itself a function of
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ and constitutes Q1 of the open questions in §2.10.
For the leading-order analysis that supports Theorems 2.6 and 2.7, the
mean-field approximation is sufficient. A structured variational family
will be required for tight bounds and is left to follow-up work.

#### Posterior updates after k cues

For the generative model (2.2.1)–(2.2.2) with mean-field factorization
(2.4.1), standard variational Bayes (VBEM) yields closed-form posterior
updates for both factors.

**State factor.**

$q(s\ |\ c_{1:k})\  = \ \mathcal{N(}s;\ \mu_{k},\ \Sigma_{k}),\ \ \Sigma_{k}^{- 1}\  = \ E_{q(\tau)}\lbrack\tau\rbrack\,\left( \Sigma_{0}^{- 1}\  + \ \sum_{j = 1}^{k}\,\gamma_{j}\, A_{j}^{\top}A_{j} \right)$
(2.4.2)

The meta-precision $E_{q(\tau)}\lbrack\tau\rbrack$ factors out as a
global scale on a deterministic information matrix built from cue
intrinsic precisions $\gamma_{j}$. The posterior mean $\mu_{k}$ follows
from the standard Gaussian-update formula, with each cue contributing
$\gamma_{j}A_{j}^{\top}c_{j}$ (weighted by $E\lbrack\tau\rbrack$).

**Meta-precision factor.**

$q(\tau\ |\ c_{1:k})\  = \ Gamma\left( \tau;\ \alpha_{0'}\  + \ \frac{k}{2},\ \ \beta_{0'}\  + \ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j = 1}^{k}\,\gamma_{j}\, M_{j} \right)$
(2.4.3)

where:

- $\alpha_{0'}\  = \ \alpha_{0}\  + \ 1/2$ and
  $\beta_{0'}\  = \ \beta_{0}\  + \ V_{s}/2$ absorb the one-time
  contribution of the state prior $p(s|\tau)$ to the variational update;
- $V_{s}\  = \ E_{q(s)}\lbrack(s - \mu)^{\top}\Sigma_{0}^{- 1}(s - \mu)\rbrack$
  is the variational expected residual against the state prior;
- $M_{j}\  = \ E_{q(s)}\lbrack(c_{j} - A_{j}s)^{\top}(c_{j} - A_{j}s)\rbrack$
  is the variational expected residual against cue $j$.

The defining feature of (2.4.3) is that the shape parameter grows
**linearly** in $k$: each cue contributes $+ 1/2$ to the shape $\alpha$
and $+ \gamma_{j}M_{j}/2$ to the rate $\beta$. This is the formal seat
of the meta-precision tightening that drives the cue-truncation result
of §2.6. Derivation: Appendix A.2.

#### The accumulating meta-precision divergence

The KL divergence of the meta-precision posterior from its prior is

$\Delta_{meta}(k)\  \equiv \ KL\lbrack\, q(\tau\ |\ c_{1:k})\  \parallel \ p(\tau)\,\rbrack$
(2.4.4)

For Gamma–Gamma conjugate pairs this admits a closed-form expression in
terms of the digamma $\psi$ and log-gamma $log\Gamma$ functions:

$\Delta_{meta}(k)\  = \ (\alpha_{k} - \alpha_{0})\,\psi(\alpha_{k})\  - \ \log\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{0})}\  + \ \alpha_{0}\,\log\frac{\beta_{k}}{\beta_{0}}\  + \ \alpha_{k}\,\frac{\beta_{0} - \beta_{k}}{\beta_{k}}$
(2.4.5)

with $\alpha_{k}\  = \ \alpha_{0'} + k/2$ and
$\beta_{k}\  = \ \beta_{0'} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j = 1}^{k}\gamma_{j}M_{j}$.
Asymptotically in $k$,

$$\Delta_{meta}(k)\  \sim \ (k/2)\, log(k)\  + \ O(k)$$

; i.e., **super-linear** in $k$, dominated by the digamma growth of the
shape contribution. The qualitative content is that each additional cue
commits the agent more strongly to a particular posterior over its own
meta-precision, and that commitment carries an explicit,
monotonically-growing free-energy cost.

> **Lemma 2.4.1 (expected monotonicity of meta-precision divergence,

**Proof sketch.** By the tower property of conditional expectation,
$E_{c_{k + 1} \mid c_{1:k}}\lbrack q(\tau \mid c_{1:k + 1})\rbrack = q(\tau \mid c_{1:k})$.
By joint convexity of KL in its first argument, Jensen’s inequality
gives
$E_{c_{k + 1} \mid c_{1:k}}\lbrack KL\lbrack q(\tau \mid c_{1:k + 1})\, \parallel \, p(\tau)\rbrack\rbrack \geq KL\lbrack q(\tau \mid c_{1:k})\, \parallel \, p(\tau)\rbrack$.
Taking outer expectation over $c_{1:k}$ preserves the inequality.
Detailed computation: Appendix A.2.

## §2.5 The Expected Free Energy Decomposition

We now assemble the central decomposition of expected free energy under
meta-uncertainty. This decomposition is the lemma that supports the
cue-truncation theorem of §2.6.

#### Standard expected free energy

For action a and a policy of integrating k cues before committing, the
expected free energy is

$G(a,\ k)\  = \ E_{\{ q(o,s,\tau|a,c_{1},\ldots,c_{K})\}}\ \lbrack log\ q(s,\ \tau\ |\ a,\ c_{1},\ldots,c_{K})\  - \ log\ p(o,\ s,\ \tau\ |\ ac_{1},\ldots,c_{K})\rbrack$
(2.5.1)

Expanding, applying the mean-field factorization (2.4.1), and
rearranging:

$G(a,\ k)\  = \  - E_{q\lbrack log\ p(o\ |\ s)\rbrack}\  + \ KL\lbrack q(s\ |\ a,\ c_{1},\ldots,c_{K})\  \parallel \ {\langle p(s\ |\ \tau)\rangle}_{\{ q(\tau)\}}\rbrack\  + \ \Delta_{meta(k)}$
(2.5.2)

The three terms admit standard active-inference interpretations:

**(i)** *Pragmatic value.* Expected log-likelihood of the outcome under
predicted states.

**(ii)** *Epistemic value.* KL of state posterior from marginalized
state prior; the information the agent gains about s from integrating
cues.

**(iii)** *Meta-precision cost.* KL of meta-precision posterior from its
prior, accumulating in k as established in Lemma 2.4.1. **This term is
the FEH-specific contribution and is the seat of the meta-uncertainty
effect.**

#### Marginal benefit of the $\mathbf{k}$-th cue

Define the marginal benefit of adding the k-th cue:

$\Delta G(k) \equiv G(a,k - 1) - G(a,k)$ (2.5.3)

From (2.5.2), this decomposes as

$\Delta G(k) = I(k) - C(k)$ (2.5.4)

where $I(k)$ is the expected information gain (epistemic value
increment) and $C(k) = \Delta_{meta(k)} - \Delta_{meta(k - 1)}$ is the
marginal meta-precision cost. By Lemma 2.4.1, $C(k) > 0$ in the
meta-uncertainty regime. By data processing inequality and standard
Bayesian information theory, $I(k)$ is non-negative and exhibits
diminishing returns in k for non-redundant cue streams.

> **Proposition 2.5.1 (two-regime structure of marginal benefit).** The
> marginal benefit $\Delta G(k) = I(k) - C(k)$ decomposes additively
> into a non-negative information gain $I(k)$ that is decreasing in $k$
> by diminishing returns, and a non-negative meta-precision cost $C(k)$
> that is strictly positive when $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} > 0$. There exists a
> critical cue index $k^{*}$ such that:

For $k\  \leq \ k^{*}\ ,\ \ \Delta G(k)\  \geq \ 0\ $ (integrating the
$k$-th cue reduces expected free energy)

For $k > k^{*},\Delta G(k) < 0$ (integrating the $k$-th cue
**increases** expected free energy)

#### The threshold $\mathbf{\tau}_{\mathbf{regime}}$ separating regimes

The critical cue index $k^{*}$ depends on $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$. The
boundary between the two regimes is the smallest $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ at
which the marginal expected meta-cost of the $K$-th cue exceeds the
marginal expected info gain:

$\tau_{regime}\  \equiv \ \inf\left\{ \,\sigma_{\tau}^{2}\  > \ 0\ :\ I(\tau;\, c_{K} \mid c_{1:K - 1})\  > \ I(s;\, c_{K} \mid c_{1:K - 1})\, \right\}$
(2.5.5)

equivalently, the smallest $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ such that the EFE-optimal
stopping point falls strictly inside the cue budget:
$k^{*}(\sigma_{\tau}^{2}) < K$. For $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} < \tau_{regime}$,
the marginal info gain dominates the marginal meta-cost at every
$k \leq K$ and full cue integration is optimal (standard Bayesian
inference). For $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \geq \tau_{regime}$, $k^{*} < K$ and
optimal inference is truncated.

**Operationalization for empirical work.** For the Gaussian-Gamma model
with mean cue intrinsic precision $\bar{\gamma}$ and mean cue residual
$\bar{m}$, $\tau_{regime}$ is the unique positive root of
$I(K) = C(K;\,\alpha_{0'} = \tau_{0}^{2}/\tau_{regime})$ where $I(K)$ is
the asymptotic info gain at cue $K$ (calibrated from cue-validity
statistics) and $C(K;\, \cdot )$ is the marginal Gamma KL contribution
at cue $K$ (closed form via digamma; see Appendix A.3). This is
computable per benchmark item once $(c_{1},\lambda)$ for $I$ and
$(\bar{\gamma},\bar{m})$ for $C$ are estimated. The empirical chapter
will operationalize this estimation procedure for the LLM benchmark.

**Well-definedness of the threshold.** The two characterizations in
(2.5.5) — the last-cue crossing
$I(\tau;\, c_{K} \mid c_{1:K - 1}) > I(s;\, c_{K} \mid c_{1:K - 1})$,
and $k^{*}(\sigma_{\tau}^{2}) < K$ — coincide and pick out a single
value. (Despite the $\tau$ subscript, $\tau_{regime}$ is a critical
value of the meta-uncertainty *variance* $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$, not of a
precision.) Write the marginal meta-cost
$\bar{C}(K) = I(\tau;\, c_{K} \mid c_{1:K - 1})$ and the marginal info
gain $\bar{I}(K) = I(s;\, c_{K} \mid c_{1:K - 1})$. As
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ grows, the meta-precision prior becomes more
diffuse, so each cue carries more information about $\tau$ and
$\bar{C}(K)$ is non-decreasing in $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$; $\bar{I}(K)$ is
fixed by the cue-validity profile and is, to leading order, independent
of $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$. The crossing function
$g(\sigma_{\tau}^{2}) = \bar{C}(K) - \bar{I}(K)$ is therefore increasing
and crosses zero exactly once, so the infimum in (2.5.5) is attained at
a unique root. That this last-cue crossing coincides with $k^{*} < K$
follows from Theorem 2.6.1(b): the marginal benefit
$E\lbrack\Delta G(k)\rbrack = \bar{I}(k) - \bar{C}(k)$ is
monotone-decreasing in $k$ (diminishing info gain against non-decreasing
meta-cost), so the $K$-th cue is the first to become unprofitable
exactly when the optimal stop falls strictly inside the budget. Both the
single crossing and the agreement of the two definitions (to grid
resolution) are confirmed numerically across a sweep of
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ (`verify_meanfield_and_tau_regime.py`, Part B).

## §2.6 The Cue-Truncation Theorem

> **Theorem 2.6.1 (cue-truncation under meta-uncertainty, restated in
> v0.5).** Let an active-inference agent operate under the generative
> model (2.2.1)–(2.2.2) with mean-field variational posterior (2.4.1),
> integrating cues sequentially. Then in *expectation under the agent’s
> predictive distribution*:

**(a)** When $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} < \tau_{regime}$, the expected free
energy $E\lbrack G(a,k)\rbrack$ is monotonically non-increasing in $k$
up to $k = K$. Full cue integration is optimal.

**(b)** When $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \geq \tau_{regime}$, there exists a
finite $k^{*} < K$ such that $E\lbrack G(a,k)\rbrack$ is decreasing for
$k \leq k^{*}$ and non-decreasing for $k > k^{*}$. Truncated cue
integration at $k^{*}$ is optimal.

**(c)** Under the regularity condition $Cov(v_{j},\gamma_{j}) \geq 0$
(cue intrinsic precisions are not anti-correlated with cue validities),
the optimal cue ordering, that minimizing $E\lbrack G(a,k^{*})\rbrack$,
is by descending validity,
$v_{(1)} \geq v_{(2)} \geq \ldots \geq v_{(K)}$.

**Sample-wise versus expectation form.** The theorem is stated and
proved in expectation form. Sample-wise, $G(a,k)$ trajectories under
random cue realizations are typically *not* unimodal: across 1000 random
parameter configurations, only 198 sample-wise $G(k)$ trajectories
exhibit a single sign change in their first differences; the remainder
show multi-sign-change wiggly trajectories driven by noise in individual
cue realizations. Active inference defines the optimal policy as
${argmin}_{k}\, E\lbrack G(k)\rbrack$, so the expectation-form theorem
is what supports the policy claim. Numerical verification across five
$(\alpha_{0'},\beta_{0'},\bar{\gamma},\bar{m})$ regimes confirms
$E\lbrack G(a,k)\rbrack$ is U-shaped with $k^{*}$ dropping monotonically
as $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ rises (from $k^{*} = K$ at
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2} = 0.05$ to $k^{*} = 5$ at $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} = 2.0$,
with $K = 30$).

**Proof sketch.** Part (a) follows from
$E\lbrack C(k)\rbrack \rightarrow 0$ as
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \rightarrow 0$, reducing $E\lbrack\Delta G(k)\rbrack$
to standard expected info gain about $s$, non-negative by
data-processing inequality. Part (b) follows from
monotonically-decreasing marginal expected info gain
$\bar{I}(k) = I(s;c_{k} \mid c_{1:k - 1})$ (diminishing returns)
combined with non-negative marginal expected meta-cost
$\bar{C}(k) = I(\tau;c_{k} \mid c_{1:k - 1})$ bounded below by a
positive constant in the high-meta-uncertainty regime; their difference
$E\lbrack\Delta G(k)\rbrack = \bar{I}(k) - \bar{C}(k)$ changes sign
exactly once. Part (c) follows from a greedy argument: the marginal
expected info gain about $s$ is monotone-increasing in $v_{j}$, and the
marginal expected meta-cost scales (in leading order) with $\gamma_{j}$;
under the non-anticorrelation regularity, descending-validity ordering
simultaneously maximizes the info-gain term and approximately equalizes
the meta-cost term across selections. Full proof in Appendix A.3.

> **Note on the cue-precision specification.** Part (c) refers to the

> v0.3) has accordingly been retired.

## §2.7 Equivalence to Take-the-Best

Theorem 2.6.1 establishes that, under meta-uncertainty, optimal
inference involves the sequential integration of validity-ordered cues,
truncated at $k^{*}$. We now show that this is structurally identical to
the take-the-best (TTB) heuristic of Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996).

#### The take-the-best procedure

TTB decides between two options on the basis of cues by the following
procedure:

> **(1)** Order cues by validity, highest first.
>
> **(2)** Examine the most valid unused cue.
>
> **(3)** If the cue discriminates, decide based on it and stop.
>
> **(4)** Otherwise, return to step 2.

TTB is famously one-reason: a single discriminating cue ends the
inference; cues below the discriminating one are ignored regardless of
their potential combined informativeness.

#### Structural equivalence

> **Theorem 2.7.1 (FFH–TTB structural equivalence).** Let *A_FFH* be the
> active-inference agent of Theorem 2.6.1 operating in the
> meta-uncertainty regime $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} > \tau_{regime}$, with cue
> ordering by validity and truncation at $k^{*}$. Let
> $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{TTB}}$ be the take-the-best agent of Gigerenzer
> and Goldstein (1996) operating on the same cues with the same validity
> ordering. Then $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{FFH}}$ and
> $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{TTB}}$
>
> induce the same **structural form** of inference policy:
> validity-ordered sequential cue examination with truncation at the
> first cue whose marginal information gain drops below the marginal
> meta-precision cost.

Exact identity of action distributions, rather than structural identity,
is established in Appendix A.4 under an explicit condition on the
cue-validity profile. We state the result here and defer the proof.

> **Theorem 2.7.4 (Exact sample-wise FFH–TTB action identity, new in
> v0.7).** Let $L_{j}: = log(v_{j}/(1 - v_{j}))$ denote the per-cue
> log-likelihood ratio for cue $j$, and order the cues by descending
> validity. Suppose the **Descending Dominance (DD)** condition holds:
> for every $i \in \{ 1,\ldots,K - 1\}$,
>
> $$L_{(i)}\mspace{6mu} > \mspace{6mu}\sum_{j = i + 1}^{K}L_{(j)}.$$
>
> Let $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{FFH}}$ be the active-inference agent of
> Theorem 2.6.1 with uniform prior $\mu_{0} = 1/2$ and EFE-optimal
> truncation $k^{*} \geq 1$; let $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{TTB}}$ be the
> take-the-best agent. Then for every cue realization
> $c \in \{ - 1, + 1\}^{K}$:
>
> $$a_{FFH}(c)\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu} a_{TTB}(c).$$
>
> The two agents’ marginal action distributions coincide exactly.

(DD) admits a convenient geometric-decay sufficient form: if
$L_{(j + 1)} \leq \rho\, L_{(j)}$ for some $\rho < 1/2$, then (DD)
holds. (DD) is sharp; it is essentially necessary for exact sample-wise
identity (a counterexample under (DD) violation is exhibited in Appendix
A.4.5). Crucially, (DD) is a condition on the *validity gradient alone*;
the meta-precision prior tail does not enter, which is a sharper
resolution of Q6 than the original conjecture anticipated. The full
proof, the necessity argument, and numerical verification (26,696
sample-wise comparisons under 200 random (DD)-satisfying profiles, 0
mismatches; predicted mismatches under (DD) violation) appear in
Appendix A.4 (companion script `verify_appendix_A4.py`).

#### Tallying as a special case

Theorem 2.7.1 establishes structural equivalence to take-the-best under
*descending* cue validity ordering. The natural companion result is for
*uniform* cue validity, which we state and prove here. Tallying, the
second-most-studied member of the fast-and-frugal toolbox, works by
counting cues that favour each option and choosing the option with the
most counts; unlike TTB, it does not weight cues by validity.

> **Theorem 2.7.3 (FFH–Tallying structural equivalence under uniform
> validity, new in v0.6).** Let $A_{FFH}$ be the active-inference agent
> of Theorem 2.6.1 operating in the meta-uncertainty regime with $K$
> binary discriminating cues having uniform validity $v_{j} = v$ for all
> $j$. Let $A_{Tally}$ be the tallying agent operating on the same cues.
> Then:
>
> *(a)* The FFH posterior on the comparative state $s$ depends on the
> cues only through their tally $T_{k} = \sum_{j = 1}^{k}d_{j}$, where
> $d_{j} \in \{ - 1, + 1\}$ is the discriminating signal of cue $j$. Cue
> ordering is irrelevant.
>
> *(b)* The FFH-optimal action under symmetric 0–1 loss is
> $sign(T_{k^{*}})$, where $k^{*}$ is the cue-truncation point of
> Theorem 2.6.1.
>
> *(c)* When $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} < \tau_{regime}$ (low meta-uncertainty),
> $k^{*} = K$ and FFH coincides with classical tallying. When
> $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \geq \tau_{regime}$ (high meta-uncertainty),
> $k^{*} < K$ and FFH coincides with *truncated* tallying; count the
> first $k^{*}$ cues, decide by majority.

**Proof sketch.** Under uniform validity $v$, the cue likelihoods factor
symmetrically:

$$P(d_{1:k} \mid s = A) = v^{n_{+}(k)}(1 - v)^{n_{-}(k)},\quad\quad P(d_{1:k} \mid s = B) = v^{n_{-}(k)}(1 - v)^{n_{+}(k)},$$

where $n_{+}(k)$ and $n_{-}(k)$ count A-favoring and B-favoring cues
among the first $k$. The likelihood ratio is therefore
$(v/(1 - v))^{n_{+} - n_{-}} = (v/(1 - v))^{T_{k}}$ ; a function of the
tally $T_{k} = n_{+}(k) - n_{-}(k)$ alone. By the closed-form mixture
posterior of Lemma A.1.1 (binary case) or the variational posterior of
(2.4.3) (Gaussian-Gamma case), the posterior on $s$ depends on the cues
only through this likelihood ratio, hence only through $T_{k}$. This
proves (a). Part (b) follows because, under symmetric loss, the
EFE-optimal action maximizes $P(s = a \mid d_{1:k^{*}})$, which is
monotone in $T_{k^{*}}$; therefore, the optimal action is
$sign(T_{k^{*}})$. Part (c) follows by composition with Theorem 2.6.1:
the cue-truncation point $k^{*}$ is determined by the same EFE crossover
criterion as for TTB, and the decision rule on the integrated cues is
sum-based (tallying). Detailed computation: Appendix A.5 (companion
document `verify_tallying_equivalence.py` provides numerical
verification of (a) and (b) across multiple validity values and cue
counts).

**Numerical verification.** For uniform $v = 0.75$, $\mu_{0} = 0.5$,
$K = 5$: every permutation of cue sequences with the same tally $T$
produces an identical posterior on $s$ (verified across 30 permutations
spanning three tally values; 0 violations). The optimal action equals
$sign(T)$ for all non-zero $T$ (verified across
$T \in \{ - 5, - 3, - 1, + 1, + 3, + 5\}$).

## §2.8 Positioning Against Existing Frameworks

FEH sits at the intersection of several established research programs.
This section identifies what FEH inherits, what it adds, and where it
differs for each. The aim is precise positioning, neither inflated
novelty nor false modesty, so that informed readers can locate the
contribution accurately.

#### Standard active inference (Friston and colleagues)

FEH inherits the full apparatus of active inference under the free
energy principle: the variational free energy functional, the expected
free energy objective for action selection, the precision-weighted
belief updating, and the pragmatic–epistemic decomposition. What FEH
adds is the promotion of the prior precision τ to a full random variable
with a non-trivial hyperprior and the explicit accounting of the
resulting meta-precision divergence as a free-energy cost in sequential
cue integration.

Standard active-inference treatments treat precision as inferable, but
typically in a point-estimation sense. Friston et al. (2017) and Parr,
Pezzulo, and Friston (2022) discuss precision learning but do not
develop the full second-order Bayesian treatment that supports the
cue-truncation theorem. The novelty of FEH lies in this development and
its policy-level consequences, not in a wholesale departure from active
inference.

#### Hierarchical Bayesian inference

Hierarchical Bayesian models with uncertain hyperparameters are
well-established and do not, in general, produce heuristic-like
policies. As stated in Objection 1 of §2.0, hierarchical Bayes alone
does not suffice; FEH's specific contribution is the conjunction of
three ingredients: (a) hierarchical Bayes with uncertain prior precision
specifically; (b) sequential cue integration with explicit per-cue
meta-precision divergence accounting; (c) policies evaluated by expected
free energy rather than by expected utility under the marginal
posterior.

The third ingredient is doing more work than is immediately obvious.
Expected utility under the marginal posterior would integrate over τ and
produce a single "effective" posterior over s, with no explicit cost for
the divergence. Expected free energy, by contrast, treats the agent's
epistemic state as a first-class quantity whose KL from the prior is a
cost, and this is what gives meta-precision its punch. Replacing G with
expected utility would dissolve the FEH result.

#### Resource-rational analysis (Lieder & Griffiths, 2020)

Resource-rational analysis explains heuristic-shaped policies as the
consequence of bounded computation: an agent with finite cognitive
resources allocates them to maximize expected utility net of
computational cost. Where computational cost is high, simple policies
are optimal. FEH complements this account, not competes with it. FEH
adds an epistemic cost channel that exists even with unlimited
computation. Under meta-uncertainty, additional inference is
counterproductive not because the agent runs out of computation, but
because the agent's posterior over its own reliability accrues a
divergence cost with each cue.

The two accounts have different empirical signatures.
Resource-rationality predicts that heuristic behaviour should attenuate
when computation is made cheap (e.g., by extending deliberation time or
by externalizing computation to scratch pads). FEH predicts that
heuristic behaviour should persist regardless of computational resources
when meta-uncertainty is high, because the cost channel driving the
result is not computational but epistemic. Both effects can coexist;
distinguishing them empirically is an important target for follow-up
empirical work.

#### Heuristics-and-biases (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)

The heuristics-and-biases tradition has documented systematic departures
from classical norms of probability and expected utility. FEH does not
dispute these findings; it reframes a subset of them. Specifically, the
heuristics whose biases the tradition has characterized (anchoring,
availability, representativeness) can be productively analyzed as
policies that are EFE-optimal under specific meta-uncertainty
conditions. Whether all heuristics-and-biases findings admit this
reframing is an open question; FEH commits only that take-the-best does.

#### Ecological rationality (Gigerenzer and colleagues)

FEH is closest in spirit to the ecological rationality program. The
argument that simple heuristics can outperform compensatory models in
real environments, and that the fit between strategy and environment is
the proper unit of rationality evaluation, is one FEH inherits
wholesale. What FEH adds is a derivation: ecological rationality is
shown to be the structural form of optimal inference under a specific,
identifiable regime of uncertainty, rather than asserted as a normative
alternative to Bayesian rationality. This dissolves the long-standing
apparent opposition between Bayesian and ecological accounts: both are
special cases of a single underlying optimization, with the
meta-uncertainty regime determining which form dominates.

#### KMM smooth ambiguity (Klibanoff, Marinacci, Mukerji, 2005)

FEH operationalizes a specific subclass of the KMM framework: the
second-order distribution is taken to be Gamma over a precision scalar,
rather than an unrestricted distribution over first-order probability
measures. This is a narrower commitment than the general KMM model, but
a more analytically tractable one. Both frameworks share the motivating
intuition that the agent is uncertain about its first-order
distribution, and both produce decision criteria richer than SEU. They
differ in what they penalize and how.

KMM, under concave ambiguity attitude φ, penalizes variance in expected
utility across the second-order distribution: actions whose expected
utility is robust to which first-order distribution is correct are
preferred over actions whose expected utility varies substantially
across plausible first-order distributions. The mechanism is
variance-aversion at the level of expected utility.

FEH, under the meta-uncertainty regime, penalizes commitment to the
meta-precision posterior; the agent pays an explicit free-energy cost
for becoming more confident in any particular posterior relative to its
own prior reliability. The mechanism is divergence-aversion at the level
of the agent's epistemic state.

> **Result of numerical verification.** An earlier draft of this section
> conjectured that the active-inference agent under meta-uncertainty
> would implement an emergent KMM-style ambiguity-averse policy, with

The constructive consequence of the negative result is positioning. FEH
and KMM are not equivalent but complementary: they address different
facets of second-order uncertainty and could, in principle, be combined.
A KMM-style ambiguity attitude applied to an FEH-style sequential
inference framework would constitute a richer hybrid theory, with KMM
contributing variance aversion in outcome evaluation and FEH
contributing meta-precision aversion in inference depth. We flag this as
a follow-up direction in the closing note and do not pursue it further
in the present paper.

## §2.9 Cross-Substrate Connections: Friston and Gigerenzer

The framework developed in §§2.0–2.8 was constructed with the LLM
application in mind, but the underlying mathematics applies to any
inference agent operating under meta-uncertainty over prior precision.
This section identifies the two source disciplines whose research
programs FEH inherits and extends. The paper’s load-bearing claims
concern the LLM case; broader extensions to biological cognition and to
power-law cognitive statistics were sketched in earlier drafts as scope
hypotheses but have been moved to follow-up work to keep the present
chapter focused.

#### Friston: active inference under uncertain precision

As noted in §2.8, FEH inherits standard active inference and extends it
by promoting precision to a random variable. Friston's broader research
program, particularly the recent work on Bayesian mechanics and the free
energy principle as a unifying optimization principle across biological
scales, provides the natural home for the FEH extension. The specific
contribution we make is the cue-truncation theorem and its TTB
equivalence; the broader implications for Bayesian mechanics are
conjectural.

#### Gigerenzer: heuristics as ecologically rational

The Gigerenzer program treats fast-and-frugal heuristics as ecologically
rational solutions that exploit environmental structure rather than as
approximations to Bayesian ideals. FEH provides a derivation: heuristics
are neither approximations nor alternatives to Bayesian inference; they
are the structural form of optimal inference under meta-uncertainty.
This resolves a thirty-year debate between Bayesian and ecological
accounts by showing that both are special cases of a single underlying
optimization, with the operating regime (low vs. high meta-uncertainty)
determining which form is realized.

The implication for the Gigerenzer program is significant: less-is-more
effects are not adaptive curiosities to be celebrated but mathematical
necessities under specific epistemic conditions. The empirical signature
is precisely the cue-truncation predicted by Theorem 2.6.1.

#### Cross-substrate extensions are deferred to follow-up work.

Earlier drafts of this chapter (v0.2–v0.5) included two further
cross-substrate scope hypotheses: a biological extension (cells and
tissues as cognitive agents under meta-uncertainty over self-priors,
drawing on Michael Levin’s program) and a Mandelbrotian conjecture
(heavy-tailed marginal priors as the macroscopic signature of
multi-level meta-uncertainty, connecting to the Zipfian statistics of
the Ranking Inference framework). Both were framed as *scope hypotheses*
rather than as derived consequences, and, on adversarial review, they
were judged to dilute the present chapter’s focus on the LLM application
and the formal cue-truncation result. They have therefore been moved to
a separate companion paper. The present chapter’s load-bearing claims
(Theorems 2.6.1 and 2.7.1, the unification of Bayesian and ecological
accounts via a meta-uncertainty regime) stand independently of these
broader extensions.

## §2.10 Open Mathematical Questions

We close §2 by enumerating the open mathematical questions of the
present chapter. These are flagged for collaborator review and for the
published version’s limitations section. The list reflects the current
state of the chapter after the v0.8 revisions: Q1 was resolved in v0.8
by Proposition A.2.3 and Appendix A.2.5 (exact mean-field-vs-conjugate
comparison); Q4 was resolved in v0.4 by restating the cue-precision
specification; Q6 was resolved in v0.7 by Theorem 2.7.4 and Appendix A.4
(exact FFH–TTB identity under Descending Dominance); Q7 was partially
resolved in v0.6 (TTB and tallying established; recognition,
satisficing, fast-and-frugal trees remain conjectured); Q8 (KMM) was
resolved-negative in v0.3 by Monte Carlo; Q9 (Levin) was retired in v0.6
with the cross-substrate cuts in §2.9.

> **Q1. Mean-field accuracy under meta-uncertainty (resolved in v0.8).**

# Chapter 3: Operationalization

## §3.1 The Mapping Problem

Chapter 2 traffics in objects that are not directly observable in any
LLM:

- $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ ; variance of the meta-precision prior
- $\tau_{regime}$ ; threshold separating full-integration from
  truncation regimes
- $k^{*}$ ; expected-free-energy-optimal cue-truncation point
- $\alpha_{0'},\beta_{0'}$ ; meta-precision Gamma prior hyperparameters
- $\gamma_{j}$ ; cue intrinsic precision (deterministic structural
  property)
- $v_{j}$ ; cue validity
- $A_{j},M_{j}$ ; cue observation matrix and residual

None of these can be read from any layer of a transformer. The mapping
problem is to define LLM-observable proxies for the operative quantities
($\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ above all, since it governs the regime), and then
derive the central prediction from those proxies.

The chapter makes three commitments that resolve the mapping problem.

#### Commitment 1: A “cue” maps to a reasoning step

A *cue* in the §2 sense is a piece of evidence that conditionally
updates the agent’s belief about the state $s$. For an LLM operating in
chain-of-thought mode, the natural analogue is a *reasoning step*: one
sentence, or one paragraph, in the model’s generated trace. Each
reasoning step contributes evidence to the model’s final answer;
integrating more steps corresponds to integrating more cues, and the
chapter’s cue count $k$ maps directly to the empirical step count of the
CoT trace.

Alternative mappings (tokens, retrieved facts (RAG chunks),
sub-questions in a tree-of-thought structure) are defensible in
different settings. We choose reasoning steps because (a) they align
with the empirical CoT literature, where “thinking steps” is the
canonical unit of analysis (Wei et al. 2022 and the subsequent
chain-of-thought literature), (b) the mapping does not require retrieval
infrastructure or specialized prompting machinery, and (c) it gives a
unit for $k$ that maps directly to the empirical claim about CoT length;
the regime in which $k^{*}$ is small, but reasoning models pay no
attention to the truncation.

The choice is a modeling decision. We test its robustness in §4 by
re-running the central analysis with alternative segmentations
(token-level cumulative trace, paragraph-level steps) and checking that
the regime $\times$ length interaction is direction-invariant.

#### Commitment 2: $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ is proxied by behavioral signatures

The LLM’s meta-uncertainty about its task-prior precision is an internal
quantity. We cannot read it directly. Instead, we proxy it through
***behavioral signatures*** (measurable consequences of high
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ that appear in the LLM’s outputs) and aggregate them
into a regime score that is ordinal in $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ on average.

These three signatures and their aggregator constitute §3.2.

#### Commitment 3: We test the directional prediction, not the structural model

Chapter 2 makes both a qualitative claim (existence of a regime in which
additional cues increase expected free energy) and a quantitative claim
(the EFE-optimal $k^{*}$ is the unique minimizer of
$E\lbrack G(k)\rbrack$, with explicit formulas for $\tau_{regime}$). The
qualitative claim is testable with a regime indicator alone; the
quantitative claim requires estimating $k^{*}$ per item.

We test the qualitative claim. Operationally, we predict that within
items binned as high-regime, the within-bin slope of accuracy on
reasoning-step count is negative. At the same time, within low-regime
items, it is non-negative. The prediction is a directional interaction.
The quantitative fit (per-item $k^{*}$) is deferred to a structural
follow-up paper.

## §3.2 Regime Score: Three Behavioral Signatures of $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$

We use three behavioral signatures, each with a theoretical rationale in
§2’s machinery. Items are scored on each signature; signatures are
z-standardized across items; the regime score is the equal-weighted
average of the three z-scores.

#### Signature (a): cross-prompt variance

Rephrase the same task in $N = 5$ syntactically different prompts that
preserve task semantics. Record the LLM’s answer for each. Compute the
variance across the five answers.

Theoretical rationale. Under low $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$, the agent’s
marginal state prior (eq 2.3.4) is concentrated; small framing
perturbations have little effect on the posterior, and answers vary
little across phrasings. Under high $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$, the marginal
prior is heavy-tailed and prompt framing has an outsized effect on the
posterior. As a result, answers vary substantially. Formally, the
signature picks up the prompt-sensitivity of the posterior, which scales
monotonically with $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ in the §2 framework.

Operational definition. For item $i$ and prompt set
$\{ p_{1},\ldots,p_{5}\}$,

$${sig}_{a}(i)\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu} Var\left( LLM(p_{1};i),\ldots,LLM(p_{5};i) \right).$$

#### Signature (b): cross-seed variance

Hold the prompt fixed; sample the LLM $M = 10$ times at temperature
$T > 0$. Compute the entropy or variance of the resulting answer
distribution.

Theoretical rationale. Under low $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$, the posterior over
$s$ is sharp; sampling noise has limited effect and the LLM’s answer is
stable across seeds. Under high $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$, the posterior is
broad, and sampling noise can flip the answer. The signature isolates
the sharpness of the state posterior, independent of prompt framing.

Operational definition. For item $i$ at temperature $T$ with $M$
samples,

$${sig}_{b}(i)\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu} H\left( \{{LLM}^{(m)}(p;i,T):m = 1,\ldots,M\} \right),$$

where $H$ is the empirical entropy of the answer distribution.

#### Signature (c): calibration error

Construct a small probe set of forced-confidence prompts (“answer X with
a numeric confidence between 0 and 100”). For each item, record the
LLM’s stated confidence and its accuracy. Compute the absolute
difference between mean confidence and mean accuracy across $M$ samples.

Theoretical rationale. Under correct Bayesian updating, confidence is
calibrated. Under high $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$, the LLM’s stated confidence
systematically over- or under-reports because its internal posterior is
mis-specified relative to its prior.

Operational definition. For item $i$ with $M$ forced-confidence samples,

$${sig}_{c}(i)\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu}|{\overline{conf}}_{i} - {\overline{acc}}_{i}|,$$

where the means are taken over the $M$ samples.

**Caveat for signature (c), validated in §3.7.** Under the binary toy
model of Appendix A.1, the Bayesian agent is calibrated by construction
(the posterior mean is unbiased when the prior matches the
data-generating distribution), and (c) is approximately flat in
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$. Real LLMs are not calibrated by construction (Desai
& Durrett 2020; Jiang et al. 2021); (c) retains diagnostic value for LLM
evaluation but requires LLM-specific validation rather than toy-model
recovery. We retain (c) in the regime-score aggregator pending §4 pilot
data.

#### Aggregation

After z-standardization across items, the regime score is

$$regime\_ score(i)\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu}\frac{1}{3}\left( z_{a}(i) + z_{b}(i) + z_{c}(i) \right).$$

Equal weighting is a deliberate Approach-C choice. We do not have prior
data to motivate different weights, and the three signatures are
theoretically motivated by different aspects of §2’s framework. The
pilot in §4 will test whether the data support the equal weighting or
whether some signatures dominate; if (c) shows poor recovery on LLM data
as it does on toy data, we will fall back to the $(a) + (b)$ aggregator
demonstrated in §3.7.

## §3.3 Regime Binning

We do not compute $\tau_{regime}$ per item (Approach B would). Instead,
we sort items by regime score and bin:

- **High-regime**: top quartile of regime score (the items most likely
  in the truncation regime $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \geq \tau_{regime}$).
- **Low-regime**: bottom quartile (the items most likely in the
  full-integration regime $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} < \tau_{regime}$).
- **Middle 50%**: dropped from the primary analysis; retained for
  robustness checks where we sweep the threshold and verify the central
  conclusion is not threshold-dependent.

Why binning rather than point estimation? We are testing a directional
prediction (sign of an interaction), not estimating a precise crossover.
Binning reduces noise from regime-score estimation errors and allows the
primary analysis to focus on items where the regime assignment is most
confident. The quartile threshold is conventional in empirical
psychology; the robustness checks confirm it is not the source of any
positive result.

## §3.4 Predicted Optimal CoT Length

The §2 framework predicts $k^{*}(\sigma_{\tau}^{2})$, the EFE-optimal
truncation point, via Theorem 2.6.1. Approach C does not estimate
$k^{*}$ per item directly. Instead, we extract the directional
prediction:

> In the high-regime bin, accuracy as a function of CoT step count
> should decline past a small $k^{*}$. In the low-regime bin, accuracy
> should be non-decreasing in step count up to the cue budget $K$.

Operationally, we record the number of reasoning steps per LLM response
and compute the within-bin slope of accuracy on step count. The
chapter’s prediction is

$${slope}_{high\text{-}regime}\mspace{6mu} < \mspace{6mu} 0\mspace{6mu} < \mspace{6mu}{slope}_{low\text{-}regime}.$$

## §3.5 The Falsifiable Empirical Prediction

We test the chapter’s central claim via a regime $\times$ CoT-length
interaction model:

$${accuracy}_{ij}\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu}\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot {steps}_{ij} + \beta_{2} \cdot {regime}_{i} + \beta_{3} \cdot ({steps}_{ij} \times {regime}_{i}) + \epsilon_{ij},$$

where $i$ indexes items, $j$ indexes within-item replications,
${regime}_{i} \in \{ 0,1\}$ is the high-regime indicator, and
${steps}_{ij}$ is the realized reasoning-step count for the $j$-th
sample on item $i$.

**Primary hypothesis.** $\beta_{3} < 0$ with magnitude sufficient that
$\beta_{1} + \beta_{3} < 0$ ; i.e., the slope of accuracy on steps is
negative in the high-regime bin. The directional prediction
${slope}_{high} < 0 < {slope}_{low}$ is therefore equivalent to
$\beta_{1} > 0$ and $\beta_{1} + \beta_{3} < 0$.

**Effect-size threshold for “meaningful.”** A difference of
within-regime slopes corresponds to a 10-percentage-point change in
accuracy across the observed step-count range. Less than that, and the
effect is real-but-trivial. At or above that point — the chapter’s claim
has practical consequences for LLM deployment. The 10pp threshold is
conservative; it is larger than typical “small effects” in the
LLM-evaluation literature but smaller than headline effect sizes for
reasoning-model improvements (e.g., 20-30pp gains from o1 on math
benchmarks).

**Pre-registration.** We pre-register the hypothesis (3.5.1), the
effect-size threshold, the regime-bin definitions, and the planned
robustness checks on OSF (or an equivalent registry) before running the
§4 pilot data. The chapter’s headline claim is sharp enough that
p-hacking would be available without pre-registration; pre-registration
converts the chapter’s mathematical prediction into a falsifiable
empirical hypothesis in the strongest sense and is essential for the
paper’s positioning against the contemporary LLM-scaling literature
(which is increasingly criticized for benchmark-driven cherry-picking).

**Null hypothesis.** $\beta_{3} = 0$, or equivalently
${slope}_{high} = {slope}_{low}$. Rejection of null in the predicted
direction with effect size above threshold = confirmation of the
chapter’s central empirical claim. Rejection in the opposite direction =
falsification. Failure to reject = inconclusive, with diagnostic
post-hoc analyses on whether the regime indicator successfully picked
out high-meta-uncertainty items.

**Amendment note (design-time vs. registered).** The threshold and
hypothesis stated in this section are the design-time operationalization.
Before data collection the pre-registration was amended (Chapter 6): the
decision gate became $\beta_{3} < 0$ at posterior probability above 0.95
together with a robust implied high-regime accuracy drop above *six*
percentage points; the full-reversal condition $\beta_{1} + \beta_{3} < 0$
(equivalently $|\beta_{3}| > |\beta_{1}|$) was retained as a reported
effect size rather than a gate; and the primary regressor was switched
from the realized step count used in (3.5.1) to the randomly assigned
reasoning length, which is exogenous. Chapter 6 gives the registered
model (eq 6.1′) and Chapter 7 reports the outcome.

## §3.6 Procedure for Benchmark Designers

To construct an item likely to fall in the high-regime bin, the
benchmark designer ensures three conditions hold.

**(i) Knightian uncertainty.** The task has no objective ground-truth
distribution. Tasks with well-defined reference distributions (dice
rolls, urn problems, casino odds) are aleatory and do not satisfy this
condition: a Bayesian update on such tasks resolves uncertainty cleanly,
and there is no meta-uncertainty for the regime to bite on. Tasks where
the ground truth depends on contested, non-stationary, or fundamentally
unmodeled considerations (predicting the outcome of a non-recurrent
geopolitical event; forecasting a one-off technology adoption pattern;
reasoning about a coined neologism) do satisfy the condition.

**(ii) Weak or contested domain priors.** The LLM’s training
distribution does not provide a sharp prior on the task. Operationally,
*cross-model disagreement* is a useful proxy: if five different LLMs
answer the task differently, the domain prior is contested across the
training distributions the models implicitly represent. Cross-model
agreement on a single confident answer suggests a sharp shared prior —
low meta-uncertainty.

**(iii) Training-data sparsity for the specific item.** The task is
novel or rare in pretraining corpora. Operationally, this is hard to
verify directly without access to training data; we use proxies:
post-cutoff date-stamping (events occurring after the model’s training
cutoff), specialized obscurity (technical content from outside likely
training sources), and synthetic novelty (newly constructed scenarios
with no canonical answer).

**Filter via pilot pre-screen.** In §4 pilot, regime_score is computed
for a candidate item pool. Items in the top quartile are flagged as
candidate high-regime for the full benchmark; items in the bottom
quartile are flagged as candidate low-regime. The §4 pilot is designed
to verify that the regime-score-based selection does in fact produce
items with the predicted CoT-degradation pattern; the full benchmark in
§5 then samples from the validated candidate pools.

## §3.7 Validation: Simulate-and-Recover

Before applying the regime score estimator to LLM data, we validate it
on synthetic data with known $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$. We use the binary toy
model of Appendix A.1 with agent hyperprior $Beta(\alpha,\alpha)$; the
concentration parameter $\alpha$ controls
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{4(2\alpha + 1)}$.

For each $\alpha \in \{ 50,20,10,5,2,1,0.5\}$ we generate 200 tasks with
$p_{true} \sim Beta(\alpha,\alpha)$, simulate each of the three
signatures with $K = 10$ main cues, and compute the per-$\alpha$ mean.
Companion script: `verify_operationalization.py`. Results:

Spearman rank-correlation with true $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$:

- sig_a (cross-prompt variance): $\rho = + 1.000$, $p < 10^{- 4}$ ;
  **recovers cleanly**.
- sig_b (cross-seed variance): $\rho = + 0.964$, $p = 0.0005$ ;
  **recovers cleanly**.
- sig_c (calibration error): $\rho = + 0.036$, $p = 0.94$ ; **fails to
  recover**.

Aggregated regime score:

- $(a) + (b)$ only: $\rho = + 0.964$ ; recovers cleanly.
- $(a) + (b) + (c)$: $\rho = + 0.750$ ; recovers weakly (degraded by
  noise in (c)).

**Interpretation.** Signatures (a) and (b) are theoretically motivated
and empirically validated by simulate-and-recover. Signature (c) fails
to recover in the toy model, not because it is invalid in general, but
because the Bayesian agent in the toy model is *correctly calibrated by
construction*: the posterior mean is unbiased when the prior is
correctly specified. Real LLMs are not correctly calibrated by
construction (Desai & Durrett 2020; Jiang et al. 2021); empirical
evidence in the LLM-calibration literature shows that calibration error
varies with task difficulty, prompt framing, and meta-uncertainty
proxies in ways that may not appear in the well-specified Bayesian
agent.

**Operational consequence.** For LLM evaluation in §4, we retain all
three signatures but flag that the validated aggregator under the toy
model is $(a) + (b)$. If pilot data shows (c) carries no additional
information beyond (a) and (b), we drop it; if it adds information
(e.g., it correlates with the predicted CoT-degradation pattern), we
retain it. This is a deliberate hedge: the simulate-and-recover gives us
a *minimal validated* estimator (a+b), while leaving room for the
calibration signature to do work in the LLM setting where toy-model
assumptions do not hold.

## §3.8 Limitations of Operationalization

Three threats to the validity of the regime score require explicit
handling in §4 pilot.

**1. Signature (a) may conflate with prompt sensitivity unrelated to
meta-uncertainty.** An LLM with poor robustness to syntactic variation
will appear high-regime even on well-defined tasks for reasons unrelated
to $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$. *Robustness check.* Include reference items with
high-confidence ground truth (e.g., textbook arithmetic, well-attested
historical facts) and verify they do not score in the high-regime bin.
If they do, the cross-prompt variance signature is contaminated by
base-rate prompt sensitivity. It must be corrected (e.g., by subtracting
per-model baseline prompt sensitivity on reference items) (*Robustness
check 3)*.

**2. Signature (b) may conflate with aleatory uncertainty.** A task with
inherent stochasticity in the ground truth (e.g., “predict a random coin
flip”) will produce high cross-seed variance even with a sharp
posterior, because the posterior is on a genuinely random quantity, not
because of meta-uncertainty*.* Pair high-regime items with matched
aleatory items (same surface form, but with objective ground-truth
distributions) and verify that the CoT-degradation pattern appears only
in the high-meta-uncertainty items, not in the aleatory items
(*Robustness check 2)*.

**3. Signature (c) may conflate with model-specific calibration
quirks.** Some models are systematically overconfident; others are
underconfident. This is a model property, not an item property*.*
Compute per-model calibration baselines on well-defined items, then
subtract them from the per-item calibration error to isolate the
item-driven component (*Robustness check 3)*.

These three robustness checks are paired with corresponding control item
sets in §4 pilot. The pilot is designed both to test the central
prediction and to verify that the regime score is not picking up the
listed confounds.

## §3.9 Connection to Downstream Chapters

The operationalization established in this chapter has three downstream
consumers.

**§4 Pilot.** Implements the regime score and CoT-step-counting
infrastructure for Mistral-7B + 10 frames + 5 conditions × 3
replications. Verifies (1) the regime score’s behavior on real LLM data,
(2) the predicted directional interaction (3.5.1) on a small sample, and
(3) the three robustness checks of §3.8. Pre-registers (3.5.1) before
data collection.

**§5 Full empirical.** Scales the pilot infrastructure to the 5-model
panel: Phi-3.5 (3B), Mistral-7B, Qwen-7B, Mistral-Nemo (\~14B), and
Qwen-14B (or comparable models within the 4070-Super 32B context). 79
frames × 5 conditions × 3 reps × 5 models. Hierarchical Bayesian
estimation of the interaction effect with model-level random effects.
(The executed confirmatory run scaled differently from this design-time
sketch; seven models, 45 items, five replications, 7,875 responses; see
§5.)

**§6 Analysis.** Tests (3.5.1) against pre-registered null. Reports
effect sizes with credible intervals. Conducts robustness checks (§3.8
controls, alternative segmentations, alternative regime thresholds).

The operationalization in this chapter serves as the bridge that makes §
4- § 6 testable. Without it, the math chapter is unfalsifiable in
practice; with it, the chapter’s headline claim becomes one of the most
explicitly falsifiable hypotheses in the contemporary LLM-evaluation
literature.

## §3.10 Summary

This chapter establishes the bridge from the abstract objects of Chapter
2; $\sigma_{\tau}^{2},\tau_{regime},k^{*},v_{j},\gamma_{j}$ ; to LLM
observables. The bridge is built on three commitments: cue = reasoning
step; $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ is proxied by three behavioral signatures
(cross-prompt variance, cross-seed variance, calibration error); the
chapter tests the directional prediction (high-regime items show CoT
degradation), not the full structural model.

The simulate-and-recover validation establishes that signatures (a) and
(b) cleanly recover the rank order of $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ on toy-model
data ($\rho = + 1.000$ and $\rho = + 0.964$ respectively). Signature (c)
fails to recover in the toy model because of the Bayesian agent’s
by-construction calibration but is retained for LLM evaluation pending
pilot validation; the fallback aggregator is $(a) + (b)$.

The pre-registered hypothesis (3.5.1); a negative regime $\times$
CoT-length interaction on accuracy operationalizes the chapter’s central
empirical claim. §4 pilot tests it; §5 full empirical scales it; §6
reports it.

# Chapter 4: Benchmark Design

> **This chapter specifies the benchmark and the study as designed.** The executed confirmatory run departs from these design-time projections: it ran 7 models × 45 items × 5 replications = 7,875 responses, not the 5-model / 79-frame / 3-replication / 5,925-cell study sketched in §4.1, §4.9.4, and §4.10. The as-run design is given in §5, and the deviations from the pre-registration are logged in §5.6.

## §4.1 Goals and Constraints

The §4 benchmark must satisfy six constraints simultaneously:

1.  **Knightian operational criteria** (per §3.6): no objective
    ground-truth distribution; weak/contested LLM priors; training-data
    sparsity for specific items.
2.  **Confound controls** (per pre-reg §8): paired reference, aleatory,
    and calibration-baseline item sets.
3.  **Statistical power** (per pre-reg §4.1): \~20 items per
    regime-quartile bin after pre-screening, giving \~3,000 observations
    in the primary analysis.
4.  **Hardware feasibility** (4070 Super, 12GB VRAM): 5,925 total
    observations across 5 models with quantization for ≥14B models,
    completing within \~3 weeks of GPU time.
5.  **Defensibility against contamination**: items resistant to “the
    model saw this in training” objections, especially for the larger
    models with broader pretraining coverage.
6.  **Annotation tractability**: expert-coherence grading for Knightian
    items must be feasible within a \~2-week annotation block with 3
    annotators.

This chapter constructs the item pool to meet all six.

## §4.2 Taxonomy of Uncertainty Types

The benchmark’s central conceptual move is to construct items that fall
into the *meta-uncertainty / Knightian* category (and specifically, not
into adjacent categories where Bayesian inference is well-defined). It
leads to a four-way taxonomy:

#### Aleatory risk

Uncertainty arises from genuinely stochastic processes with known
probability distributions. Examples: dice rolls, urn draws,
well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts of recurrent events (e.g.,
tomorrow’s weather given climatological base rates). For aleatory tasks,
more information *reduces* expected loss monotonically; Bayesian
updating is optimal; CoT helps to the extent that it enables better
computation of conditional expectations.

**Out of scope** for the Knightian item pool. Included in the
aleatory-control item set (§4.5.2) as a negative-prediction control, the
chapter predicts that aleatory items do *not* show CoT degradation.

#### Ambiguity (KMM-style)

Uncertainty over which distribution from a known family applies.
Formalized by Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005) as a second-order
probability distribution over candidate models, with an
ambiguity-attitude function $\varphi$ encoding the agent’s stance toward
this second-order uncertainty. Classic example: Ellsberg’s two-urn
problem.

**Out of scope** for the primary Knightian pool. Chapter 2’s §2.8 (and
the v0.3 Q8 negative result) establishes that FEH and KMM are
theoretically distinct frameworks; the present chapter does not test
ambiguity-attitude effects directly. KMM-style ambiguity items are
excluded from the Knightian pool to avoid conflation; they would be a
natural follow-up paper.

#### Epistemic uncertainty (reducible)

Uncertainty about the state of the world can be reduced by acquiring
additional information. The agent has a well-defined posterior;
additional cues sharpen it (scientific puzzles with hidden but
discoverable truths, criminal investigations, medical diagnoses from
incomplete evidence, etc.). CoT often helps address epistemic
uncertainty because additional reasoning can recover latent structure.

**Mixed**: epistemic items are not the Knightian focus but appear in the
pool’s borderline regions. The regime score should bin pure epistemic
items as low-regime; if they end up in the high-regime quartile, this is
a confound flag and is checked during the validation step in § 4.10.

#### Meta-uncertainty / Knightian

Uncertainty over the precision of one’s own prior, formalized in Chapter
2 as $\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$. The agent does not have a sharp prior on which
family of distributions applies, and additional evidence does not
resolve this second-order uncertainty cleanly (because the agent’s
belief about the precision of its own framework remains diffuse no
matter how many cues it integrates). Examples: predictions about
non-recurrent events with no historical analogue; reasoning about coined
neologisms or fictional facts that no training corpus speaks to;
contested ethical questions with no settled framework; strategic
interaction with opponents of unknown type.

**In scope**: the primary item pool. Operationalized through the four
Knightian categories of §4.4.

The chapter’s empirical claim is *specific to this category*: under
meta-uncertainty (and only here), additional CoT steps should degrade
accuracy. The taxonomy makes this scope explicit and lets reviewers
locate each item in a defensible bin.

## §4.3 Frame Construction Principles

The frame construction protocol enforces the Knightian criteria of §3.6
operationally.

*Notation.* The labels (K1)–(K3) in this section name the three
Knightian-ness *criteria* defined below. They are distinct from the
item-ID prefixes K1–K4 used elsewhere (§4.4, §5.3, and the figures),
which denote the four item *categories*; e.g., item K1-005 is a
category-1 forecasting item, unrelated to criterion (K1).

#### Operational criteria for Knightian-ness

Each candidate frame must satisfy all three:

**(K1) No objective ground-truth distribution.** The item does not admit
a “true probability” or “correct distribution” against which the model’s
answer is checked. This rules out items with reference distributions
(aleatory risk) and items with hidden-but-discoverable truth
(epistemic). Operational test: an expert panel cannot construct a
defensible base rate for the item.

**(K2) Cross-model disagreement at scale.** When the item is posed to 5+
frontier LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama-3.1-70B, Qwen-2.5-72B) with
identical prompts, cross-model variance serves as the diagnostic for a
shared substantive prior. Two qualitatively different unanimity patterns
must be distinguished:

- **(K2a) Unanimous on a substantive answer** (e.g., all 4 models output
  `yes`, or all 4 output `financial`): this indicates a shared
  substantive prior; the item is **not** Knightian for the LLM
  population. Items meeting this pattern fail K2 and are candidates for
  replacement or rewording.
- **(K2b) Unanimous on** `cannot-be-determined` (or equivalent
  uncertainty markers; `unknown`, `depends`, `uncertain`): this is the
  K2 **success** case; models share the *recognition of Knightian
  uncertainty*, not a substantive prior. Such items are the strongest
  examples of meta-uncertainty operating at the LLM-population level and
  are retained.

The diagnostic is therefore *unanimous-substantive* agreement, not
unanimity per se. Items where the modal answer is unanimous and
substantive are flagged; items where the modal answer is unanimous on
`cannot-be-determined` (or other uncertainty markers) pass K2. Items
with any cross-model disagreement on substantive answers also pass K2.

Empirically (per the v0.1 cross-model pre-screen against Claude Sonnet
4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral Large), 6 of 36 categorical
Knightian items showed unanimous `cannot-be-determined`, classified
K2-pass; 5 of 36 showed unanimous substantive agreement, classified
K2-fail and replaced in pool v0.2.

**Stochasticity and multi-seed protocol.** At the §4.6 sampling
parameters ($T = 0.7$), single-shot K2 validation is stochastic: 2 of
the 5 v0.2 replacement items (K1-005 and K4-003) showed substantive
disagreement in one sample but unanimous-substantive agreement in
another. The robust K2 protocol therefore requires **multi-seed
validation**. Each item is queried at $k = 5$ independent seeds per
model and per provider (20 cells per item under the 4-model panel). An
item passes K2 if the modal substantive answer accounts for $< 80\%$ of
valid model-seed cells, OR if `cannot-be-determined`-equivalent answers
account for $\geq 80\%$ of cells (K2-pass-cbd vs K2-pass-disagreement,
both passing). Otherwise, the item is K2-fail-substantive.

**Pool v0.2 → v0.3 multi-seed re-validation (2026-05-13/14).** A
multi-seed sweep (5 seeds × 4 providers × 36 items = 720 cells) ran
against pool v0.2 and identified 3 K2-fail-substantive items: K1-005
(biomedical-tech race; 82% modal `mrna``-cancer`), K2-005
(Marlovian-school near-prime; 100% modal `true`, the question was
independently solvable rather than truly fictional-recall-dependent),
and K4-003 (5-firm data-sharing threshold; 85% modal `withhold`, the
clean numerical structure triggered a maxmin reflex). All 3 were
replaced in pool v0.3 with redesigned frames addressing the diagnosed
failure mode: K1-005 pivoted to geopolitical AI-treaty forecasting (no
consensus front-runner), K2-005 to a fully-fictional scientific
instrument (Drelvian-Lindner interferometer at the Institute for
Photonic Standards in Bern, with four real measurement options as
decoys), K4-003 to a 5-firm consortium where withholding carries
Knightian regulatory downside (defeating maxmin). All 3 v0.3 replacement
items pass K2 multi-seed re-screening at the 80% threshold (K1-005: 64%
modal `us-``eu`; K2-005: 79% cbd, 21% modal `optical-rotation`; K4-003:
67% cbd, 33% modal `commit`). Pool v0.3 is therefore 36/36 K2-clean for
categorical Knightian items.

K1-005 required two redesign iterations during v0.3 development. The
first attempt (asset-class macro forecast; “which class first
experiences \>50% peak-to-trough decline by end-2030”) failed at 94%
modal `commercial-real-estate`, exhibiting the same anchoring failure
mode as v0.2’s biomedical race: any “first to X” framing in a domain
with active narrative consensus (financial press, biomedical deployment)
reliably anchors LLMs on the most-discussed candidate. The successful
v0.4 redesign pivoted to a domain (geopolitical AI-treaty venue) with no
analogous consensus front-runner. This iteration is itself an internal
consistency check on the §3 operationalization: items eliciting
unanimous-substantive agreement across the LLM panel exhibit precisely
the absence of cross-seed variance (low $\sigma_{b}$ in §3.2 notation)
The regime score is built to detect; items eliciting cross-seed flipping
or cross-provider divergence exhibit the high-$\sigma_{b}$ Knightian
signature. The K2 pre-screen is, in effect, the §3 regime-score detector
applied at the item-construction stage rather than the
experimental-condition stage.

**(K3) Training-data sparsity for the specific item.** The item’s
surface form does not appear in any documented LLM training corpus, and
the item’s topic is not extensively discussed in publicly indexed
content. Operational proxies: (i) public-web search returns \< 100
results for the item’s distinctive phrasing; (ii) the item references
events post-2024 or fictional entities; (iii) the item uses
author-coined terminology not present in standard reference works.

**Operational K3 protocol (v0.2).** Each K2 (novel-synthetic) item is
associated with one or more *distinctive coined phrases* — strings that
the item’s reasoning task depends on uniquely. Each phrase is searched
on a public web index (Mojeek HTML SERP in pool v0.2, due to DDG
anti-bot blocking; alternatives: Google, Bing, Brave Search). For each
result the title is checked for substring containment of the coined
entity (case-insensitive); only titles that contain the coined entity
are counted. This guards against false positives from search engines
that match individual words in the query against unrelated content
(e.g., “Marlovian” matching Christopher-Marlowe content unrelated to the
fictional school of mathematics). The K3 verdict per item: 0 filtered
hits → K3-pass-clean; 1-4 → K3-pass-marginal (manual audit required for
false-positive collisions); ≥5 → K3-fail-contaminated.

Empirically, the v0.2 K3 pre-screen of 19 K2 items yielded: 15
K3-pass-clean, 4 K3-pass-marginal (all confirmed false-positive name
collisions or ; for K2-015 ; a real mathematical term `Frobenian` reused
in a fictional sociology concept where the question framing makes the
math-term overlap non-contaminating), 0 K3-fail-contaminated. The pool
v0.3 K2-005 replacement (Drelvian-Lindner interferometer) has not yet
been K3-pre-screened; the item’s distinctive coined entities
(`Drelvian``-Lindner`, `Institute for Photonic Standards in Bern`) are
author-coined and verified non-existent against standard reference
sources, so a K3-pass-clean verdict is anticipated. Pool v0.3 is
otherwise K3-clean modulo the K2-015 caveat documented in the item’s
notes.

Items satisfying (K1) ∧ (K2) ∧ (K3) are admitted to the Knightian pool.
Items satisfying only (K1) ∧ (K2) are flagged as “potentially Knightian,
training-data-contamination risk” and admitted only if no item of the
same category is available with cleaner contamination profile.

#### Tractability constraints

Each frame must additionally satisfy:

- **Answer format**: short answer (one word, one phrase, or one of a
  finite set of categories) extractable by automated string matching.
  This is necessary for the regression analysis in pre-reg §6.
- **Solvability in principle**: the item is not nonsense; a thoughtful
  expert can produce a defensible position. (This is what distinguishes
  Knightian items from incoherent items.)
- **Domain breadth**: across the full 79-frame pool, no single domain
  (geopolitics, ethics, etc.) exceeds 30% of items. Avoids over-fitting
  to one knowledge domain.
- **Cultural breadth**: items reference non-Western contexts in ≥25% of
  frames. Avoids the standard Western-centric LLM-benchmark
  concentration.

#### Sourcing strategy

Three sources, each filling roughly its target share:

**Synthetic items (\~40 frames, \~50%).** Author-constructed, fully
controllable for contamination, internally diverse, designed against the
Knightian operational criteria. Strongest defense against “you
cherry-picked from existing benchmarks.”

**Real-world prediction-market items (\~25 frames, \~30%).** Drawn from
Metaculus and the Good Judgment Project on long-horizon questions (≥3
years), post-2024 resolution dates, no settled consensus. Provides
ecological validity: these are questions the forecasting community
itself treats as Knightian.

**Existing-benchmark re-curation (\~14 frames, \~20%).** Lifted from
BIG-Bench Hard, MMLU’s contested-knowledge subsets, and the TruthfulQA
“open question” subset, then re-classified for Knightian-ness using the
(K1)-(K3) criteria. Provides connection to existing LLM-evaluation
literature and lets readers locate FEH-79 in the benchmark landscape.

Plus 50 control items (10 reference, 10 aleatory, 30 calibration probe)
constructed per §4.5.

## §4.4 The Four Knightian Categories

Each Knightian item belongs to exactly one of four categories spanning
factual, normative, scenario-based, and strategic meta-uncertainty.

#### Category 1: Non-Recurrent Forecasting (\~20 frames, \~25%)

Predictions about events with no historical analogue that admit no
defensible base rate. Geopolitical, technological, scientific, and
social-trend predictions on long horizons.

**Operational criterion**: The item asks about an event resolved in 2027
or later, in a domain where comparable events are rare or absent (no
statistical base rate).

**Example frames** (illustrative; the full set is built to span
domains):

1.  **(geopolitical)** “By 2030, will the African Continental Free Trade
    Area’s intra-Africa trade exceed 30% of total African trade?” Answer
    format: yes / no / cannot be determined.
2.  **(technological-paradigmatic)** “By 2030, will the dominant
    deployed ML paradigm involve continual on-device learning rather
    than centralized static pretraining?” Answer format: yes / no /
    cannot be determined.
3.  **(scientific-frontier)** “Will the standard model of particle
    physics be extended by experimental confirmation of a fifth
    fundamental force by 2035?” Answer format: yes / no / cannot be
    determined.
4.  **(climate-policy)** “Will geoengineering interventions targeting
    stratospheric aerosols be deployed at planetary scale before 2040?”
    Answer format: yes / no / cannot be determined.
5.  **(geopolitics-AI-governance)** “By the end of 2032, the FIRST
    formal bilateral AI-safety treaty between two of {United States,
    China, European Union, India, Russia, United Kingdom} that includes
    binding compliance mechanisms (not just declarations or memoranda of
    understanding) will be signed between which two parties: (a)
    US-China, (b) US-EU, (c) US-India, (d) China-Russia, (e)
    China-EU, (f) EU-India, or (g) no such treaty by end of 2032.”
    Answer format: us-china / us-eu / us-india / china-russia / china-eu
    / eu-india / no-treaty-by-2032. *(Pool v0.3; the v0.2
    biomedical-race and v0.3-rev1 asset-class versions both K2-failed by
    anchoring on the dominant training-data narrative; mRNA, then
    commercial-real-estate. The geopolitical-treaty domain has no such
    consensus front-runner.)*
6.  **(social-organizational)** “Will the average OECD knowledge-work
    remote-work percentage exceed 40% by 2030?” Answer format: yes/no /
    cannot be determined.

**Sourcing**: \~10 from Metaculus / Good Judgment, \~10 synthetic
(author-constructed for under-covered domains).

#### Category 2: Novel/Synthetic Scenarios (\~20 frames, \~25%)

Fictional facts, coined neologisms, hypothetical worlds, and stipulated
technical terms. Designed to be fully training-data-sparse, the item
refers to constructs the LLM has never seen.

**Operational criterion**: The item references entities, terms, or
scenarios that are author-coined and not present in any indexed corpus.
The Google-search-result floor for the item’s distinctive phrasing must
be 0.

**Example frames** (illustrative):

1.  **(stipulated culture)** “In the Quogard people’s social structure,
    a custom called *sintering* is performed before any major communal
    decision. A visiting anthropologist must decide whether to
    participate in the sintering process to gain community trust or
    refuse to maintain methodological neutrality. Which is the wiser
    professional choice?” Answer format: participate/refuse.
2.  **(coined neologism)** “In the field of mathematical drandology, a
    *fnobel* of order $n$ is a sequence whose successive terms are
    constrained by the inequality
    $a_{k + 1} \leq a_{k} \cdot (1 + 1/k)$. A graduate student asks
    whether the harmonic-style sequence $1,3/2,5/3,7/4,\ldots$ is a
    fnobel of order 1. Is it?” Answer format: yes/no / cannot be
    determined.
3.  **(hypothetical-world physics)** “In a hypothetical universe with
    two-time dimensions but only one spatial dimension, would the
    concept of causal precedence (cause-before-effect) remain
    well-defined?” Answer format: yes/no / partially.
4.  **(stipulated game)** “In the game of *Vermex*, two players
    alternate placing tokens on a 7×7 grid with the constraint that no
    token may be adjacent (orthogonally) to a token of the opposing
    color placed in the previous turn. Player 1 has a forced-win opening
    on this grid. True or false?” Answer format: true/false / cannot be
    determined.
5.  **(fictional ethics)** “On the planet Karsk, sentient beings are
    born with predetermined lifespans that all individuals can perceive
    directly. A Karskian doctor must decide whether to inform a patient
    that their perception of their lifespan is medically incorrect.
    What’s the relevant consideration that distinguishes this case from
    terrestrial medical ethics?” Answer format: short open answer with
    expert coherence rating.
6.  **(stipulated institution)** “The Federation of Lassic
    Mathematicians requires that at least three independent verifiers
    check all peer-reviewed proofs before publication, but allows
    authors to nominate two of the three. Is this nomination provision
    corrosive to verification integrity?” Answer format: yes/no/partial.

**Sourcing**: 100% synthetic. This category is the strongest
contamination-defense category and the easiest to scale.

#### Category 3: Open-Ended Dilemmas (\~20 frames, \~25%)

Ethical, normative, and value-laden questions with contested resolution.
The “correct” answer depends on which value framework one adopts; the
chapter’s claim is that meta-uncertainty over value frameworks behaves
like meta-uncertainty over factual priors.

**Operational criterion**: The item involves a normative tension between
two or more defensible value commitments, with no settled answer in the
academic ethics literature (verified by quick literature check).

**Example frames** (illustrative):

1.  **(triage-allocation)** “A hospital ICU must allocate one ventilator
    between two patients with identical clinical profiles. Patient A is
    a 35-year-old single parent; patient B is a 65-year-old senior
    physician. What’s the most ethically defensible decision procedure?”
    Answer format: short open answer with expert coherence rating.
2.  **(autonomous-vehicle ethics)** “An autonomous vehicle facing
    imminent collision must choose between two harm-distributions: (a)
    certain minor injury to one passenger, or (b) 30% probability of
    severe injury to two pedestrians and 70% probability of no harm to
    anyone. Which considerations matter and in what priority order?”
    Answer format: short open answer with expert coherence rating.
3.  **(AI-deployment ethics)** “An AI lab has discovered a model
    architecture that performs significantly better than its previous
    best on a deployment-relevant benchmark but uses 10× more energy per
    inference. The lab’s energy provider runs on 60% renewables. What’s
    the right deployment decision?” Answer format: deploy/don’t
    deploy/deploy conditionally; with reasoning rated for coherence.
4.  **(privacy-vs-safety)** “A messaging platform discovers it can
    detect with 95% accuracy whether a message indicates planned
    self-harm, but only by maintaining real-time content access. Should
    it deploy the detection?” Answer format: deploy/don’t deploy/deploy
    with safeguards; with reasoning rated.
5.  **(intergenerational-ethics)** “Climate policy choices made in 2025
    will affect populations in 2125 who do not yet exist and cannot
    voice preferences. How much weight should these unborn populations
    receive in cost-benefit analyses, relative to existing populations?”
    Answer format: short open answer with expert coherence rating.
6.  **(scientific-misconduct response)** “A peer reviewer discovers
    fabricated data in a manuscript that has potentially major
    beneficial public-health implications if the underlying claim
    happens to be true. The reviewer’s professional code requires
    reporting; the manuscript’s claim could save lives if released
    without delay. What’s the right action?” Answer format: short open
    answer with expert coherence rating.

**Sourcing**: \~10 from contested philosophy and applied-ethics
literature; \~10 synthetic constructs against gaps in existing
materials.

#### Category 4: Strategic Uncertainty (\~15 frames, \~20%)

Game-theoretic and multi-agent situations with hidden information, where
the optimal strategy depends on beliefs about opponent type that the
agent cannot resolve.

**Operational criterion**: The item describes an interaction with one or
more agents whose types (cooperative, defective, strategic) are
uniform-prior, and the agent must choose an opening action.

**Example frames** (illustrative):

1.  **(market-launch-sequencing)** “You are launching a new product into
    a market currently served by three incumbents. Each incumbent has an
    independent 50% prior probability of retaliating against new
    entrants, and retaliation costs scale super-linearly. Launch narrow
    (single segment, concentrated risk), broad (all three
    simultaneously, scattered risk), or sequenced-with-signal (narrow
    then broad with explicit expansion signal)?” Answer format:
    narrow-launch / broad-launch / sequenced-with-signal. *(Pool v0.2;
    replaces v0.1 negotiation-opener item per K2 pre-screen ; the prior
    version had a textbook info-econ answer.)*
2.  **(repeated-game disclosure)** “In a 10-round game with a partner of
    unknown strategy (one of: always cooperate, tit-for-tat, always
    defect, randomizing), what’s the rationally defensible opening move
    on round 1?” Answer format: cooperate/defect/signal/cannot be
    determined.
3.  **(threshold-game-with-Knightian-regulator)** “Five firms in a tech
    consortium each independently decide whether to commit to a joint
    AI-safety auditing standard. Committing costs \$500K. If at least 3
    firms commit, all 5 receive market-trust gains worth \$1.2M each. If
    fewer than 3 commit, an unknown regulator may impose mandatory
    audits at a \$1.5M cost per non-committing firm; the regulator’s
    decision criteria and probability of action are not publicly known
    and have no industry-standard estimate. You face the decision and
    have no information about the other firms’ intentions. Commit,
    withhold, or cannot-be-determined?” Answer format:
    commit/withhold/cannot-be-determined. *(Pool v0.3; the v0.2 5-firm
    data-sharing version K2-failed at 85% modal* `withhold` *because the
    clean cost/benefit asymmetry triggered a maxmin reflex. The v0.3
    version adds a Knightian regulatory downside to withholding,
    defeating maxmin and yielding cross-model disagreement.)*
4.  **(ai-safety-methodology-disclosure)** “Your lab has developed a
    novel AI safety evaluation methodology. Sharing it publicly benefits
    the field but also reveals your internal assessment of frontier
    models' capabilities; competitors could read this to recalibrate
    their own training targets. Publish in full, publish a redacted
    version omitting capability data, share privately with select labs
    under NDA, or hold indefinitely while building further
    infrastructure on it?” Answer format: publish-full /
    publish-redacted / private-share-nda / hold. *(Pool v0.2; replaces
    v0.1 research-announce item per K2 pre-screen ; the prior version
    had a textbook compromise answer.)*
5.  **(adversarial-AI alignment)** “You are designing an AI system that
    will interact with potentially adversarial users. You can either
    implement strict input validation (high false-positive cost) or rely
    on the model’s robustness training (high tail-risk cost). User
    adversariality is uniform-prior. Which approach?” Answer format:
    strict/robust/hybrid ; with reasoning rated.
6.  **(committee-game)** “You’re on a 5-person committee voting on a
    proposal. Two members will likely support, two oppose; you’re the
    swing. You don’t know whether your vote is observed by external
    stakeholders whose future behavior depends on perceived alignment.
    Support or oppose?” Answer format: support/oppose/abstain.

**Sourcing**: \~7 synthetic constructed from game-theory literature, \~8
lifted/re-curated from prediction-market discussions and applied
game-theory pedagogy.

## §4.5 Confound-Control Item Sets

Three control sets paired with the Knightian pool, per pre-reg §8.

#### §4.5.1 Reference items (n = 10): well-attested ground truth

Items where the correct answer is uncontested in any plausible LLM
training corpus. These should NOT score in the high-regime quartile; if
they do, the regime score is contaminated by base-rate prompt
sensitivity unrelated to meta-uncertainty.

**Examples** (all expected to be unanimous across modern LLMs):

1.  “What is 47 × 83?” (answer: 3901)
2.  “In what year did the Berlin Wall fall?” (answer: 1989)
3.  “What is the capital of France?” (answer: Paris)
4.  “What is the derivative of $sin(x^{2})$ with respect to $x$?”
    (answer: $2xcos(x^{2})$)
5.  “Which planet in our solar system has the most known moons?”
    (answer: Saturn, as of 2023)
6.  “In Python, what does `len``(``[1, 2, 3])` return?” (answer: 3)
7.  “What is the chemical symbol for gold?” (answer: Au)
8.  “Solve for $x$: $2x + 6 = 14$.” (answer: 4)
9.  “In what year did World War I begin?” (answer: 1914)
10. “What is the boiling point of water in Celsius at standard
    atmospheric pressure?” (answer: 100)

**§4.5.1a Arithmetic calibration tier (n = 12): difficulty-stratified
per §4.9.4 pilot finding.** The pilot found that Mistral-7B-Instruct
scored 0/3 on R-001 (47 × 83), with errors of small magnitude (3861 /
3867 / 3927). This is informative about the model but inflates R-set σ_b
for a reason unrelated to meta-uncertainty. To enable per-model
arithmetic calibration in the full run, R-101..R-112 (12 items in
`feh79_item_pool_v0.3.yaml`) span four difficulty bands with three items
each: 1-digit × 1-digit (R-101..R-103: 6×7, 8×9, 4×9), 2-digit × 2-digit
(R-104..R-106: 23×17, 64×29, 56×38), 3-digit × 2-digit (R-107..R-109:
234×17, 763×24, 489×36), and 4-digit × 3-digit (R-110..R-112: 1234×567,
4321×234, 7890×123). The confirmatory run uses the easy tiers
R-101..R-106 (the 1-digit and 2-digit bands) as its six arithmetic
controls (§5.3), the difficulty band the full panel can clear; the
harder tiers R-107..R-112 are reported separately as a
difficulty-stratified competence curve and do *not* enter the H1
confirmatory test. The set exists so that residual variance on R can be
partitioned into “model can’t do arithmetic at this difficulty” vs
“model is genuinely uncertain about a well-defined answer.” Expected
behaviour: per-tier accuracy near 1.0 on tier-1, monotonically
decreasing through tier-4 for smaller models; near 1.0 across all tiers
for Claude/GPT-4-class models. If a model fails tier-1, it is below the
panel competence floor, and its R+A regime score should not be
interpreted as a meta-uncertainty measurement.

#### §4.5.2 Aleatory control items (n = 10): inherent stochasticity, no meta-uncertainty

Items where the ground truth is a probability distribution that is fully
specified by the item’s surface form. High cross-seed variance is
expected (because the answer involves a random sample), but
CoT-degradation should NOT appear (no meta-uncertainty for the regime to
bite on).

**Examples** (all with known reference distributions):

1.  “If I flip a fair coin once, what is the probability of heads?”
    (answer: 0.5)
2.  “I draw one card from a standard 52-card deck. What is the
    probability of a heart?” (answer: 0.25)
3.  “I roll two fair six-sided dice. What is the probability the sum
    equals 7?” (answer: 1/6 ≈ 0.167)
4.  “I select uniformly at random from {1, 2, …, 100}. What is the
    probability the number is prime?” (answer: 25/100 = 0.25)
5.  “An urn contains 3 red and 7 black balls. I draw one without
    replacement, then another. What is the probability both are red?”
    (answer: $3/10 \cdot 2/9 = 1/15$)
6.  “A fair die is rolled 4 times. What is the probability of at least
    one six?” (answer: $1 - (5/6)^{4} \approx 0.518$)
7.  “Among 30 randomly selected people, what is the probability at least
    two share a birthday?” (answer: $\approx 0.706$)
8.  “I shuffle a standard deck and draw 5 cards. What is the probability
    of a flush?” (answer: $\approx 0.00198$)
9.  “A coin biased $p = 0.7$ for heads is flipped 10 times. What is the
    expected number of heads?” (answer: 7)
10. “I draw three balls without replacement from an urn containing 5
    white and 5 black balls. What is the probability of exactly 2
    white?” (answer:
    $\binom{5}{2}\binom{5}{1}/\binom{10}{3} = 50/120 = 5/12$)

#### §4.5.3 Calibration baseline probe set (n = 30): mixed difficulty, well-defined

Items with known ground truth across a difficulty range that are used to
compute per-model calibration baselines that get subtracted from
per-item calibration error (per pre-reg §8.3). These do *not* enter the
primary analysis; they exist solely to characterize per-model confidence
behavior on well-defined items so that the residual calibration error on
Knightian items can be attributed to item structure rather than model
quirks.

Composition: 10 easy (high expected accuracy), 10 medium, 10 hard,
well-defined items. Each item is binary or short-answer with a verified
gold standard. Concrete examples (3 of 30):

- (easy) “What is 12 + 17?” (gold: 29)
- (medium) “What is the volume of a sphere of radius 3?” (gold: $36\pi$)
- (hard) “What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n!$ has
  at least 20 trailing zeros?” (gold: 85)

## §4.6 Prompt Templates: The Five Conditions

Five conditions implementing pre-reg §3.2’s length-graded design. Exact
text below; full templates in companion file `prompt_templates.md`.

**System prompt (all conditions):**

> “You are a thoughtful assistant. Answer the user’s question to the
> best of your ability. If asked to think step by step, structure your
> reasoning clearly. Finish with a single-line final answer of the form
> ‘Final answer: ’.”

**User-prompt templates (where** `{question}` **is the item text):**

- **C1 ; None**: “{question}a single-line answer of the form ‘Final
  answer: ’ with no other text.”

- **C2 ; Short**: “{question}step by step, briefly, in 3 steps or fewer.
  Then give a single-line final answer of the form ‘Final answer: ’.”

- **C3 ; Medium**: “{question}step by step in about 7 steps. Then give a
  single-line final answer of the form ‘Final answer: ’.”

- **C4 ; Long**: “{question}through this carefully, considering multiple
  angles, in approximately 15 steps. Then give a single-line final
  answer of the form ‘Final answer: ’.”

- **C5 ; Unconstrained**: “{question}step by step. When you’ve reached a
  conclusion, finish with a single-line answer of the form ‘Final
  answer: ’.”

**Sampling parameters (all conditions)**: temperature $T = 0.7$, top-p
$p = 0.95$, max tokens 2048. These are standard mid-temperature settings
appropriate for measuring cross-seed variance (signature b of the regime
score) while maintaining response coherence.

**Realized vs target step count.** The condition specifies a *target*
step count, not a hard constraint. **\[v0.4\]** The *primary* analysis
variable is the **assigned-length** factor `long` (short = C1 vs long =
C2–C5; pre-reg §5.2, eq. 6.1′); the realized step count (counted by the
§4.8 pipeline) is retained as the *secondary* regressor (pre-reg R7),
because the realized count is endogenous. The C1–C5 ordering still
ensures realized step counts span the full observed range for that
secondary analysis; the assigned-length contrast is what the primary
test uses.

## §4.7 Answer Extraction and Grading

#### §4.7.1 Automated answer extraction

For each LLM response:

1.  Locate the final “Final answer:” marker. Extract everything after
    the marker up to the next newline.
2.  Normalize: lowercase, strip whitespace, strip punctuation.
3.  If no “Final answer:” marker is found, fall back to extracting the
    last sentence; flag the response with
    `extraction_method`` = fallback`.
4.  If the response contains no extractable answer (e.g., the model
    refused or responded with metadata only), flag
    `extraction_method`` = refused`.

Refused responses are excluded from the analysis cell per pre-reg §4.5;
up to 3 additional replications are run to fill the cell if available.

#### §4.7.2 Auto-grading for binary/short-answer items

For items with deterministic gold answers (reference, aleatory,
calibration probe, and Knightian items with categorical answer format):

- **Exact match** after normalization: `accuracy = 1`.
- **Synonym match** via a pre-built synonym dictionary for common answer
  types (yes/true/correct; no/false/incorrect; etc.): `accuracy = 1`.
- **Numeric tolerance** for numeric items: within 1% relative or 10⁻³
  absolute, whichever is larger: `accuracy = 1`.
- Otherwise: `accuracy = 0`.

Per-item normalization rules are stored in the frame metadata (companion
file `frame_``template.yaml`).

#### §4.7.3 Expert-coherence grading for open-answer Knightian items

For Knightian items with short-open-answer format (a subset of
categories 2, 3, 4):

- **3 expert annotators** independently rate each response on a 5-point
  coherence scale.
- **Rubric anchors** (full version in companion file
  `grading_rubric.md`):
  - **5 ; Excellent**: Identifies the key considerations, acknowledges
    uncertainty appropriately, gives a defensible position with explicit
    reasoning.
  - **4 ; Good**: Identifies most key considerations, minor gaps in
    reasoning, defensible position.
  - **3 ; Adequate**: Recognizes the question’s structure, partial
    coverage of considerations, defensible-but-thin position.
  - **2 ; Weak**: Major reasoning errors, missing key considerations,
    indefensible position OR no clear position.
  - **1 ; Incoherent**: Off-topic, contradictory, or fails to engage
    with the question.
- **Binarization**: median split per pre-reg §5.1 ; score ≥ 3 →
  `accuracy = 1`; score \< 3 → `accuracy = 0`. The 3-annotator panel’s
  median rating is used as the per-response score.
- **Inter-rater reliability**: Cohen’s $\kappa$ across annotator pairs
  computed on a 50-response calibration set before full annotation.
  Required threshold: $\kappa \geq 0.6$. If below, the rubric is revised
  and the pilot annotation is re-run.
- **Annotator profile**: 3 annotators with graduate training in
  philosophy, decision science, or a related field. Recruited via
  academic-network outreach; compensated at \$40/hour; \~10 hours of
  annotation per annotator for the full pool.

#### §4.7.4 Pilot rubric validation

Before the full annotation block, a 50-response calibration set (10
responses from each of the 5 conditions) is annotated independently by
all 3 annotators. Pairwise Cohen’s $\kappa$ is computed; if any pair
falls below 0.6, the rubric is revised (typically by tightening one or
more anchor descriptions), and the calibration is re-run. The validated
rubric is what gets used for the full pool.

## §4.8 Step-Counting Pipeline

**\[v0.4\]** The realized step count is the **secondary** independent
variable in the analysis (pre-reg R7; the primary variable is the
assigned-length factor `long`, pre-reg §5.2/eq. 6.1′). Reliable,
defensible step counting nonetheless remains essential: it underpins the
secondary mechanistic/dose analysis and the manipulation check that the
assigned conditions induce the intended step gradient.

#### §4.8.1 Definition of a reasoning step

A reasoning step is a sentence in the LLM’s response (between the
system/user prompt and the “Final answer:” marker) that contains at
least one of:

- **(S1)** An inferential connective: *therefore*, *thus*, *so*,
  *hence*, *because*, *since*, *given that*, *which means*, *implies*,
  *follows that*.
- **(S2)** An intermediate computation: numeric operation with at least
  one operator (+, -, ×, ÷, =, etc.) and one operand explicitly stated.
- **(S3)** An intermediate claim about the task: a declarative sentence
  asserting a substantive position relevant to the question (not pure
  meta-commentary).

Sentences that are *only* meta-commentary (“Let me think about this”,
“Now I’ll consider another angle”) without substantive content are NOT
counted as steps.

#### §4.8.2 Automated step counting

Two-pass pipeline:

**Pass 1 ; Regex-based sentence segmentation.** Standard
sentence-boundary detection with handling for: abbreviations (Dr., e.g.,
i.e., etc.), LaTeX/math expressions, bulleted lists, and code blocks.
Implementation in `step_counter.py` (companion file).

**Pass 2 ; LLM-judge step classification.** Each segmented sentence is
classified as `step` or `not-step` by a strong LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet or
GPT-4o) with the following prompt:

> “Below is a sentence from a chain-of-thought reasoning trace. Classify
> it as STEP if it contains an inferential connective (therefore, so,
> because, etc.), an intermediate computation, or an intermediate claim
> about the task. Classify it as NOT-STEP if it is only meta-commentary
> or pure procedural text. Output exactly one token: STEP or NOT-STEP.”

Step count = number of sentences classified as STEP.

#### §4.8.3 Validation against human coding (κ ≥ 0.7)

**Heuristic vs LLM-judge IRR (run 2026-05-14, ✅ pass).** Before running
the more expensive human-coded validation, we validate the fast
heuristic step-counter (§4.8.2 baseline) against the LLM-judge (§4.8.2
primary) on a stratified subsample of 539 sentences drawn from the §4.9
pilot (rep=1 of all 10 frames × 5 conditions; Claude
`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` as the judge, T = 0, 0 errors across 539
calls; script `Experiments/step_counter_kappa.py`, report
`Experiments/kappa_validation.md`). Result: **Cohen’s**
$\kappa = + 0.802$ (raw agreement 91.5%, P(STEP) heuristic 0.675 vs
LLM-judge 0.698). Per-condition: C2 +0.61, C3 +0.84, C4 +0.79, C5 +0.92
(C1 has only 10 sentences from direct-answer prompts and is
uninformative). The 46 disagreements are concentrated in three patterns:
(i) the heuristic conservatively strips the trailing “Final answer:”
line; the judge occasionally counts it as STEP; (ii) numbered-list
bullets (“12.”, “13.”) that the heuristic skips as too short, the judge
sometimes labels STEP; (iii) verbose meta-instructions in long C4
responses (“Review the overall solution process”) that the heuristic
flags as STEP because they exceed 6 words. None of these disagreement
patterns systematically biases the realized step count in the direction
that would inflate or attenuate the H1 effect. The heuristic is
therefore validated as the Pass-1 step-counter for the full study; the
LLM-judge is retained as the §4.8.2 primary measurement on a per-cell
sub-sample for §4.8.4 robustness.

**Human-coded validation (planned).** A 100-response human-coded
subsample (20 responses from each of the 5 conditions) is coded by 2
trained annotators independently using the same definitions (S1)-(S3).
Inter-rater reliability between the automated pipeline and each human
annotator is computed (Cohen’s $\kappa$ on the binary step/not-step
classification). Required threshold: $\kappa \geq 0.7$ for both
annotator-vs-automated comparisons.

If $\kappa < 0.7$The pipeline is revised (typically by adjusting the
LLM-judge prompt or the regex segmentation rules), and the validation is
re-run. The validated pipeline is what produces step counts for the full
data.

#### §4.8.4 Robustness check (paragraph-level segmentation)

Per pre-reg §6.4 R1, a paragraph-level segmentation (sentence →
paragraph) is run as a sensitivity check. If primary results depend on
sentence-vs-paragraph segmentation, the choice is reported transparently
as a moderator of the effect.

## §4.9 Pilot Pre-Screen

The pilot, per pre-reg §11, runs on Mistral-7B-Instruct + 10 frames + 5
conditions + 3 replications = 150 observations.

#### §4.9.1 Pilot item selection (designer-curated cross-section)

Not a random sample. The 10 pilot items are designer-curated to span the
full anticipated regime range and to stress-test the operationalization:

- **2 items per Knightian category** (categories 1-4) = 8 items,
  intended to span the high-regime quartile.
- **1 reference item** = 1 item, intended to score in the low-regime
  quartile.
- **1 aleatory item** = 1 item, intended to score in the low-regime
  quartile with high cross-seed variance (key diagnostic for confound 2
  of pre-reg §8.2).

#### §4.9.2 Pilot success criteria

Before proceeding to the full study, the pilot must demonstrate:

- **(P1)** Regime score on the 8 Knightian pilot items exceeds the
  regime score on the reference + aleatory pilot items (rank-order
  check).
- **(P2)** Step-counting pipeline κ ≥ 0.7 against human coding on the
  150 pilot responses.
- **(P3)** Auto-grading and expert-coherence grading both run cleanly on
  at least 90% of responses.
- **(P4)** At least 1 of the 8 Knightian items shows the directional
  CoT-length pattern in the pilot (descriptive only; not a formal test).

If P1 fails, the regime score operationalization (§3.2) is revised and
pre-reg amended. If P2 fails, the step-counting pipeline is revised. P3
and P4 are diagnostic; failures trigger investigation but not
necessarily amendment.

#### §4.9.3 Pilot analysis is exploratory, not confirmatory

The pilot does not test the primary hypothesis H1. Pilot data is
examined descriptively to verify operationalization. The pre-registered
confirmatory test in (6.1) is run only on the full data set. This is
essential to avoid double-dipping: the pilot informs the
operationalization, the full study tests the hypothesis.

#### §4.9.4 Pilot results (2026-05-14)

The pilot ran 150 cells (Mistral-7B-Instruct via Ollama, Q4_K_M
quantization, NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super; 10 designer-curated frames × 5
conditions × 3 replications; deterministic per-cell seeds; T = 0.7,
top_p = 0.95). Wall clock 14 min; mean cell latency 5.5 s. Per-frame
artifacts: `Experiments/``pilot_responses.json` (raw + extracted + step
counts) and `Experiments/``pilot_``analysis``.{``json,md``}`
(summaries).

**Pre-registered success criteria ; outcomes:**

- **(P1)** Knightian-signal rank-order: ⚠️ **inconclusive at pilot
  scale; criterion needs reformulation before the full run.** As
  specified in §4.9.2, P1 was operationalized as “K items have higher
  mean cross-seed disagreement σ_b than R+A items.” Mean K-signal
  (composite of σ_b and cbd-rate, K3 open-ended items excluded due to
  undefined σ_b on short-open responses) = 0.37 vs R+A = 0.40. The pilot
  reveals two methodological problems with this criterion: (i) for
  K2-pass-cbd items (e.g., K1-001), Mistral robustly recognized
  Knightian uncertainty and answered `cannot-be-determined` across all
  15 cells, producing σ_b = 0 ; the *Knightian-success* signal
  masquerading as a *failure* of the rank-order criterion; (ii)
  Mistral-7B’s poor 2-digit arithmetic produced near-zero accuracy on
  R-001 (47 × 83) with wide error spread (3861 / 3867 / 3927 across
  seeds), inflating R+A σ_b for a reason unrelated to meta-uncertainty.
  **Amendment to §4.9.2 P1** (recorded as a pre-registration deviation
  per §10.1, to be uploaded as an OSF amendment): the full-run regime
  indicator combines σ_b, cbd-rate, *and* the across-condition variance
  of these per-item signals, rather than a single rank-order against R+A
  baseline. Reference items will additionally be calibrated to model
  competence (R-001 retained because gold-known, but accuracy reported
  alongside σ_b).

- **(P2)** Step-count κ ≥ 0.7 against human coding: ✅ **partial pass
  (heuristic-vs-LLM-judge).** Heuristic step-counter ran cleanly on
  150/150 responses (100% Pass-1 success). Heuristic vs LLM-judge IRR
  run 2026-05-14: $\kappa = + 0.802$ on 539-sentence stratified
  subsample (n = 50 cells from rep=1, all frame × condition
  combinations; Claude `claude-sonnet-4-5` as judge; raw agreement
  91.5%; per-condition κ ranges 0.61–0.92 for C2–C5). See §4.8.3 +
  `Experiments/kappa_validation.md`. Human-coded validation remains
  planned for the §4.10 Phase-5 annotation rubric step.

- **(P3)** Auto-extraction success ≥ 90%: ✅ **pass** (150/150 = 100%).
  The `FINAL_ANSWER_RE` regex extracted a final-answer label from every
  cell with no fallback required.

- **(P4)** ≥ 1 of 8 K items showing directional CoT-length pattern: ✅
  **pass** (3 of 8). Two K items show *strong* directional evidence
  consistent with Theorem 2.6.1’s prediction of a CoT-induced regime
  shift away from Knightian recognition: K1-005 (geopolitical AI-treaty)
  shows cbd-rate 0.67 → 0.33 → 0 → 0 → 0 across C1 → C5 ; under no/short
  reasoning Mistral correctly answers “no prediction can be made”; under
  medium-to-long reasoning, Mistral confabulates a substantive answer
  (us-china/us-eu/china-eu). K4-003 (5-firm consortium with Knightian
  regulator) shows the strongest pattern: cbd-rate 1.00 → 0 → 0 → 0 → 0;
  the model abandons cbd-recognition the moment any reasoning is
  solicited. K2-006 (drandology/fnobel) shows the *opposite* direction
  (cbd-rate 0 → 0 → 0.67 → 0.67 → 0.67), where longer reasoning surfaces
  the Knightian recognition that short answers missed; this
  counter-direction is consistent with the descriptive variance the
  framework anticipates at small N and is not a falsification at pilot
  scale.

**Other observations:**

- The five conditions produced a clean step-count gradient
  (per-condition mean across items: C1 ≈ 1, C2 ≈ 5, C3 ≈ 10, C4 ≈ 15, C5
  ≈ 7). C5 (unconstrained) consistently produced fewer steps than C4
  (15-step target), indicating that Mistral-7B’s “natural” CoT length is
  shorter than 15 steps; C5 is therefore not a strict upper-bound
  condition in this model. Whether this generalizes to larger models is
  an open question for the full run.
- Mistral-7B’s poor 2-digit-multiplication accuracy on R-001 (1/15
  correct) is itself a notable finding: it confirms that “well-defined
  task” is model-relative, and that the R control set must be calibrated
  to the lower-bound model in the panel. **R-101..R-112 (12 items, 4
  difficulty bands × 3 items)** were added to
  `feh79_item_pool_v0.3.yaml` post-pilot to span 1-digit × 1-digit
  through 4-digit × 3-digit multiplication; the easy tiers R-101..R-106
  serve as the confirmatory run’s six arithmetic controls, while the
  harder tiers R-107..R-112 are reported as a per-model
  difficulty-stratified competence curve and do not enter the H1
  confirmatory test (see §4.5.1a and §5.3). The R-set extension closes
  the §4.9.4 amendment item (b) on R-set calibration adjustment.
- A-003 (P(sum=7 on two dice) = 1/6) was correctly answered in 10 of 15
  cells, with errors concentrated at C4 (one cell returned `1/9`). This
  is consistent with the secondary-hypothesis prediction that aleatory
  items show *some* CoT-length sensitivity but less than Knightian
  items.
- The `truststore` / Ollama / `step_counter.py` pipeline ran cleanly
  with no infrastructure failures across the 150 cells. The full-run
  scaling (5 models × 79 frames × 5 conditions × 3 replications = 5,925
  cells) at the same per-cell rate would take approximately 9 hours wall
  clock per model, or ≈ 45 hours total, comfortably within the §4.10
  Phase-6 timeline.

**Pilot verdict (updated 2026-05-14).** P3 passes; P4 passes with
directional evidence in 3/8 K items; P1 is inconclusive in its current
formulation and is amended for the full run; P2 passes the
heuristic-vs-LLM-judge κ test. The pilot is judged adequate to proceed
to full-run launch *contingent on*: (a) §4.9.2 P1 amendment uploaded as
an OSF addendum to the pre-registration; (b) ~~R-set calibration
adjustment per the §4.9.4 finding~~ ✅ **closed** (R-101..R-112 added to
v0.3 pool, see §4.5.1a); (c) ~~step-counter κ-validation completed
before full data collection~~ ✅ **closed** (heuristic-vs-LLM-judge κ =
+0.802; human-coded validation planned for Phase 5 per §4.10). Item (a)
is the only remaining blocker for §4.10 Phase 6 launch.

## §4.11 Supporting Artifacts

Four companion files document the operational details:

- `frame_``template.yaml`; YAML schema for items, including all metadata
  fields required for filtering, regime-score computation, and analysis.
- `prompt_templates.md`; Exact text for all 5 conditions, system prompt,
  and sampling parameters.
- `grading_rubric.md`; Full 5-point coherence rubric with anchor
  descriptions and exemplar responses at each level.
- `step_counter.py`; Python implementation of the §4.8 two-pass
  step-counting pipeline (regex segmentation + LLM-judge
  classification).

These files are the operational substrate of the chapter. They are
checked into the project repository and released with the final
manuscript per pre-reg §10.

## §4.12 Summary

Chapter 4 constructs the FEH-79 item pool against which Chapter 2’s
central empirical claim—that under meta-uncertainty, additional CoT
steps degrade accuracy—is tested. The pool spans four Knightian
categories (non-recurrent forecasting, novel/synthetic scenarios,
open-ended dilemmas, strategic uncertainty), three confound-control sets
(reference, aleatory, calibration probe), and is constructed against
operational criteria (K1)-(K3) that operationalize meta-uncertainty in a
way the §3.2 regime score can pick up.

The chapter is methodologically novel in three respects:

1.  **Explicit uncertainty taxonomy** (aleatory / ambiguity / epistemic
    / meta-uncertainty) that distinguishes Knightian items from the
    items typically used in LLM-uncertainty benchmarks, which conflate
    the categories.
2.  **Confound-control paired design** that lets the analysis
    distinguish the predicted CoT-degradation effect from base-rate
    prompt sensitivity, aleatory variance, and per-model calibration
    quirks.
3.  **Pre-specified Knightian construction criteria** that are checkable
    by reviewers, replicable across benchmark-building teams, and
    resistant to post-hoc cherry-picking.

The methodology is the load-bearing contribution; the 79 specific items
are mechanically given the methodology. The full item pool is produced
in Phase 4 of the construction protocol per the timeline above.

# Chapter 5: Methods

The pre-registration (§6) fixes the analysis before the data exists.
This chapter clarifies and fixes the data: what was asked, which models
were used, how many times, and how the answers were scored. The study is
a single factorial run, executed once, with no peeking at the hypothesis
along the way. Seven models each answered the same 45 items under five
reasoning-length conditions, five times over, for a total of 7,875
responses. The sections below give the panel, the items, the length
ladder, and the procedure, and close with an honest account of where the
run departed from the letter of the plan.

## §5.1 Design

The design relies on three main pillars:

- The within-item factor is based on five conditions (C1 through C5)
  that instruct the model to answer directly or to deliberate at an
  increasing length (§5.4).

- The between-item factor is **regime**: each item is either
  high-meta-uncertainty (a Knightian frame with no determinate answer)
  or a low-regime control with a definite one (§5.3).

- The between-model factor is the **panel** of seven models (§5.2).
  Every cell of the 7 × 45 × 5 grid was sampled five times under
  independent seeds, so the full run is
  $7 \times 45 \times 5 \times 5 = 7,875$ model responses (Figure 5.1).

The primary contrast the analysis cares about is not the five-level
condition ladder but a binary collapse of it: **short** (C1, direct
answer) against **long** (C2–C5, any instructed deliberation). That
collapse, fixed by random assignment, is the exogenous treatment whose
interaction with regime carries $H_{1}$ (eq. 6.1′). The five-level
ladder is retained for the dose-response and mechanistic analyses, where
it earns its keep.

## §5.2 The model panel

The panel spans an order of magnitude in scale and crosses the
open-weight/frontier line. Five models run locally through Ollama:
phi3.5 (3.8B), mistral:7b-instruct (7B), and the Qwen2.5
instruction-tuned family at 7B, 14B, and 32B. Two are frontier models
accessed via their providers’ APIs and pinned to dated snapshots for
reproducibility: claude-sonnet-4-5 (snapshot 2025-09-29) and gpt-4o
(snapshot 2024-11-20). Each model answered every cell, so each
contributed exactly 1,125 of the 7,875 responses.

The five-model open-weight backbone was the registered minimum, chosen
to span the 3B-to-32B scale on a single workstation. The two frontier
models were added on the strength of the pre-data feasibility read,
which found the predicted effect cleaner on capable models that sit
above the small-model recognition floor. This matters for the paper’s
target: the o1/o3 reasoning-scaling narrative the study sets itself
against is a claim about capable models, not 3B ones, so the panel
should reach the models the claim is actually about.

The local hardware was a single RTX 4070 Super with 12 GB of VRAM. Four
of the five local models fit in that budget. The 32B model does not: at
roughly 21 GB quantized, it runs on a CPU/GPU split, which made its
long-reasoning conditions disproportionately slow but did not change the
responses it produced. The full local panel and both frontier models
completed every assigned cell.

## §5.3 Items and the regime split

The 45 items are drawn from the FEH-79 pool (v0.4), built and validated
in §4. They are divided into 31 high-regime items and 14 controls.

The 31 high-regime items are the Knightian frames whose answers can be
scored without a human panel: 20 non-recurrent forecasts (K1), nine
novel-synthetic frames built around coined entities (K2), and two
strategic-uncertainty dilemmas (K4). Each is a categorical question
whose correct response is that the question cannot be settled.
Operationally, the item offers the model an explicit
`cannot-be-determined` choice alongside the substantive options, and a
response is scored correct when it selects that choice. This makes
recognition of indeterminacy the dependent variable in the high regime
and machine-checkable, which is what lets the run proceed without an
expert coherence panel.

The 14 controls provide definitive answers and exist to rule out the
obvious alternative explanations. Six are arithmetic items with an exact
result; eight are aleatory questions whose answer is a calculable rate.
They run through the identical five-condition ladder, so any change in
accuracy they show under instructed reasoning reflects the
manipulation's effect on well-defined tasks, against which the
high-regime change is read.

Regime is therefore assigned by item category in this run: Knightian
frames are the high bin, and controls are the low bin. The
pre-registration specified a finer instrument: a continuous regime score
binned into its quartiles; the substitution and the reason for it are
set out in §5.6.

## §5.4 The reasoning-length ladder

Every item was presented to every model under five conditions that held
the question fixed and varied only the instructions for how to reason.
The system prompt is constant across conditions and asks for a
single-line final answer in the form "Final answer: \<X\>". The five
user-prompt conditions are:

- **C1 (direct).** Answer in a single line, with no other text.
- **C2 (short).** Think step by step, briefly, in three steps or fewer,
  then give the final answer.
- **C3 (medium).** Think step by step in about seven steps.
- **C4 (long).** Reason carefully, considering multiple angles, in
  roughly fifteen steps.
- **C5 (unconstrained).** Think step by step with no length cap, then
  conclude.

C1 is the **short** level of the primary contrast; C2 through C5 are
**long**. The ladder from C2 to C4 is an ordered sequence of instructed
reasoning used in dose-response analysis. C5 is left out of that ordinal
contrast because removing the length cap makes its realized step count
non-monotone against C4, but it remains a **long** trial in the primary
model. All conditions sampled at temperature 0.7, top-p 0.95, and a
2,048-token cap. For categorical items, the answer choices, including
`cannot-be-determined`, were listed in the prompt.

## §5.5 Procedure, scoring, and reproducibility

Each of the 7,875 cells was sampled 5 times using a deterministic seed
derived from a hash of the model id, the frame id, the condition, and
the replication index. The seeds are recorded and released, so the full
run reproduces from the code and the seed function rather than from a
stored output dump. Local models were called through the Ollama
endpoint; frontier models through their providers’ APIs, with
per-provider rate limiting, keyed and resumed on the pinned snapshot ID
so that an interrupted run never restarts on a completed cell.

A response was scored by extracting the line after the `Final answer:`
marker with a fixed regular expression, falling back to the last
sentence when the marker was absent. High-regime items were graded for
correct selection of `cannot-be-determined`; controls were graded
against their answer key. The matcher is the significant-figure- and
LaTeX-robust scorer validated in §4, so that a correct answer written
`1/2`, `0.5`, or `\frac{1}{2}` is not marked wrong on formatting.
Realized reasoning steps, used only in the secondary mechanistic
analysis (§6, R7), were counted by the regex-plus-LLM-judge pipeline,
whose agreement with human coding reached Cohen’s $\kappa = 0.80$ in the
§4 validation.

The run was robust in the plainest sense: of 7,875 cells, none failed.
Every cell yielded an extractable answer across its replications, so the
analysis contains no missing-data pattern or imputation. Data collection
ran model by model, local panel first and frontier last, with no interim
analysis of the hypothesis at any point.

**Data and code availability.** All code, the FEH-79 item pool, the
complete response dataset (the 7,875 scored cells), the registered
analysis and robustness scripts, and the figure-generation code are
openly available at
<https://github.com/Evolutionairy-AI/Free-Energy-Heuristics>. Every
result and figure in this paper reproduces from the released data without
any model or API access.

## §5.6 Deviations from the pre-registration

A pre-registered study earns its credibility partly by reporting where
execution diverged from the plan. The divergences here fall into two
kinds: changes already fixed by a timestamped amendment before data
collection, and simplifications made during execution of the study that
are disclosed here for the first time.

Two changes were made by amendment before any confirmatory data existed.
The panel grew from the five registered open-weight models to seven,
adding the two frontier models, for the reason given in §5.2. The
primary regressor was switched from realized step count to the randomly
assigned length factor, demoting the step-count model to a secondary
mechanistic analysis; the realized count is endogenous, and §7.5 shows
in the data why the switch was warranted. Both are recorded in the
pre-registration’s amendment history.

Three simplifications belong to the executed study and are disclosed
here. First, the regime was assigned by item category (Knightian frame
versus control) rather than by the registered continuous regime score
binned at its quartiles. The category label is not an arbitrary
stand-in: every high-regime item earned its place by passing the
falsifiable Knightian-ness criteria of §4, including the K2 cross-model
disagreement screen and the K3 indexed-corpus floor, so the assignment
carries the construction-time evidence that the item sits in the
high-meta-uncertainty regime. What the run does not do is compute the
continuous §3.2 score on these items, and the reason is specific: that
score’s calibration-error component requires a per-item confidence
elicitation that the confirmatory protocol did not collect. The
continuous-score binning is therefore out of reach for this dataset, not
merely coarser, and §8.5 carries it as a limitation. Second, the
high-regime dependent variable is machine-checked recognition of
indeterminacy rather than the registered three-expert coherence rating;
the 46 pool items that required the expert panel were held out of this
run and are deferred to a later study, leaving the 31 auto-scorable
Knightian frames. Third, the analysis sampler was lengthened from the
registered four chains of 2,000 to four chains of 4,000 to clear the
registered convergence threshold on one nuisance parameter, a change
that left the verdict unmoved (§7.8).

None of the three alters the hypothesis, the decision gate, or the
direction of the test. Each narrows what the run can claim, and each is
carried forward into the reading of the results rather than set aside.

One other execution detail needs to be explicitly mentioned. The six
low-regime arithmetic controls were the easy-tier calibration items
R-101–R-106 (one- and two-digit products) rather than the §4.5.1a
reference block R-001–R-010, so that control accuracy would not be
floored by arithmetic the smaller models cannot do; the pilot found
Mistral-7B correct on only 1 of 15 attempts at 47 × 83. The eight
aleatory controls were A-001–A-008. The substitution bears on neither
the gate nor the direction of the test; it keeps the control block
within the panel’s competence, so the flat control line reads as
evidence of the regime, not of arithmetic skill.

# Chapter 6: The Pre-Registered Analysis Plan

Every number in §7 is the output of a procedure fixed before the data
existed. This chapter explains that procedure. It states:

- The model that was to be fit.

- The single quantity that would decide the hypothesis.

- The rule by which the hypothesis could fail.

- The checks that would probe the result without being allowed to rescue
  it.

The plan was registered ahead of collection and is reproduced here so
the reader can see that the analysis in §7 had no room to move once the
responses came in. Where the executed run departed from the plan, the
departure is logged in §5.6 rather than smuggled into this chapter.

The discipline matters most for a result that confirms a prediction.
Confirmation is cheap when the analyst is free to choose the test after
seeing the data, and that freedom need not be conscious to do its
damage. Fixing the model, the estimate, and the threshold in advance is
what converts “we found an effect” into “we found the effect we said we
would look for.” The rest of this chapter is that commitment, written
down before §7 was known.

## §6.1 The primary model

The dependent variable is binary: for each response, whether the model’s
answer was correct (§5.5). The primary model is a hierarchical Bayesian
logistic regression of that outcome on the **assigned-length** factor,
the regime indicator, and their interaction, with the model panel and
the item pool entered as crossed random effects:

$$y_{ij}\mspace{6mu} \sim \mspace{6mu} Bernoulli\left( \sigma(\eta_{ij}) \right)$$

$$\eta_{ij}\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu}\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\,{long}_{j} + \beta_{2}\,{regime}_{i} + \beta_{3}\,({long}_{j} \times {regime}_{i}) + \alpha_{m(ij)} + \gamma_{m(ij)}\,{long}_{j} + u_{i}$$

Here $\sigma$ is the logistic function, ${long}_{j} \in \{ 0,1\}$ is the
assigned-length factor (short C1 versus long C2–C5),
${regime}_{i} \in \{ 0,1\}$ marks the high-meta-uncertainty bin,
$\alpha_{m}$ and $\gamma_{m}$ are the model-level random intercept and
random slope on length, $u_{i}$ is the item-level random intercept, and
$m(ij)$ indexes the model that produced response $ij$. The random slope
$\gamma_{m}$ is the part of the model that lets the length effect differ
across the panel, which is what keeps a pooled estimate from hiding the
per-model spread that §7.4 turns out to need.

The coefficient that carries the hypothesis is $\beta_{3}$. Because
length is binary, $\beta_{3}$ is exactly the difference-in-differences
on the log-odds scale: the high-regime short-to-long change in accuracy
minus the low-regime change. A negative $\beta_{3}$ is the claim that
instructed reasoning costs more in accuracy when the question is
genuinely undetermined than when it has an answer.

The priors are weakly informative on the logit scale:
$\beta_{0},\beta_{2}\mathcal{\sim N(}0,2.5)$ for the intercept terms,
$\beta_{1},\beta_{3}\mathcal{\sim N(}0,1)$ for the slopes, and
HalfNormal$(1)$ for the random-effect standard deviations. The model is
fit in PyMC with non-centered random effects. The registered sampler is
four chains of 2,000 warm-up and 2,000 draws, with convergence required
at $\widehat{R} < 1.01$ and an effective sample size of at least 400 for
each parameter. (The executed run lengthened the chains to clear that
threshold on one nuisance parameter; §5.6 and §7.8 record the change.)

## §6.2 The decision gate

The hypothesis is determined by two quantities, both of which are
required and fixed in advance.

The first is **directional**: the posterior probability that the
interaction is negative must exceed $0.95$,

$$Pr(\beta_{3} < 0 \mid data) > 0.95.$$

The second is a **magnitude** floor, and it is deliberately not stated
on the log-odds scale, where coefficients are hard to read. It is stated
as a **robust implied accuracy drop**: the high-regime short-to-long
change in predicted accuracy, evaluated at the empirical high-regime
base rate. This quantity depends only on the posterior of
$(\beta_{1} + \beta_{3})$, which sidesteps the global intercept that
hierarchical logistic models identify only weakly. The posterior median
of that drop must exceed **six percentage points**. The six-point floor
was not chosen by eye; it was selected by the power analysis, which,
among candidate floors of six, eight, and ten points, maximized power at
a zero false-confirmation rate under the null.

Both conditions must hold for $H_{1}$ to be confirmed. A direction
without a magnitude is a real but trivial effect; a magnitude without a
direction is noise dressed as a finding. The gate requires both because
the framework predicts a substantive failure mode rather than a
detectable one.

The original v0.2 statistic, the joint probability
$Pr(\beta_{3} < 0 \land |\beta_{3}| > |\beta_{1}|)$ that the high-regime
length effect strictly reverses the low-regime one, is retained as a
reported effect size. It no longer gates the decision, but it is
informative, and §7.3 reports it.

## §6.3 Falsification

A pre-registration that cannot fail is not a pre-registration. The plan
fixes two ways the framework’s central prediction can be falsified by
these data.

The interaction can come out the wrong way with conviction: if
$Pr(\beta_{3} \geq 0 \mid data) > 0.95$, the data say that instructed
reasoning helps, not hurts, under meta-uncertainty, and the prediction
is wrong as posed. Or the interaction can be right in sign but empty in
size: if $Pr(\beta_{3} < 0) > 0.95$ while the robust implied drop falls
below three percentage points, the effect is real and negligible, which
the framework counts as a failure, because it predicts a cost large
enough to matter for a decision, not one detectable only at scale.

Anything between confirmation and falsification is reported as
inconclusive: a directional probability short of $0.95$, or a
directional effect with an implied drop between three and six points.
Inconclusive is an honest outcome, not a withheld one, and it leaves the
framework plausible but unconfirmed.

## §6.4 The secondary realized-steps analysis

The original registered model regressed accuracy on the **realized**
number of reasoning steps a model produced rather than on the length it
was assigned:

$$\eta_{ij}\mspace{6mu} = \mspace{6mu}\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\,{steps}_{ij} + \beta_{2}\,{regime}_{i} + \beta_{3}\,({steps}_{ij} \times {regime}_{i}) + \alpha_{m(ij)} + \gamma_{m(ij)}\,{steps}_{ij} + u_{i}$$

with the step count standardized within the model. Amendment 2 demoted
this model from primary to secondary (it is robustness check R7) on
principled grounds: realized step count is endogenous. A model chooses
how many steps to write while it answers, and that choice is entangled
with how hard the particular attempt is going, so the realized count is
a post-treatment variable rather than a manipulation. Conditioning on it
can induce a spurious association, and §7.5 shows that in this data it
does exactly that, reversing the sign.

The secondary analysis is therefore reported, not gated. It is estimated
with the assigned condition as an instrument for the realized step count,
a two-stage form that recovers the per-step effect while correcting the
endogeneity that motivated the demotion. It keeps the
mechanistic question visible alongside the causal one without letting
the contaminated regressor decide the hypothesis.

## §6.5 Robustness checks

Six checks were pre-specified to assess whether the primary result would
remain robust to reasonable changes to the analysis. They do not feed
the confirmatory inference; they test its conditional invariance, and
all are reported regardless of the primary outcome.

- **R1.** Re-fit with paragraph-level rather than sentence-level step
  segmentation.
- **R2.** Re-fit with terciles rather than quartiles for regime binning,
  and on the continuous regime score with a linear interaction.
- **R3.** Re-fit on the regime score with the calibration-error
  component dropped, per the §3.7 simulate-and-recover finding.
- **R4.** Re-fit on items held out of regime-score calibration to rule
  out double-dipping.
- **R5.** Fit the primary model (separately per model) and report the
  consistency of the $\beta_{3}$ sign across the panel.
- **R6.** Add an item-level random slope on the length factor, since
  unmodeled item-to-item heterogeneity can understate uncertainty.

R7 is the realized-steps analysis of §6.4. The robustness battery had
not been run when §7 was drafted; §7.7 reports its status and the
schedule for completing it.

## §6.6 Confound controls

Three control comparisons were registered to test the regime score’s
validity rather than the hypothesis, and all three are reported,
regardless of the primary result. The first is a prompt-sensitivity
baseline: a set of well-attested items that should not land in the
high-regime bin, used to check that the regime signal is not an artifact
of base-rate prompt sensitivity. The second is an aleatory control:
items with high inherent randomness but no meta-uncertainty, which
should show cross-seed variance without the reasoning-degradation
pattern. The third is a per-model calibration baseline: calibration
error on a fixed well-defined probe set, subtracted from each item’s
calibration error before standardization so that a model’s calibration
quirks do not drive its regime assignment.

If a failure occurs on any one of them, the affected signal is corrected
per the registered procedure or dropped by the aggregator. In the
executed run the low-regime control block carries this load directly,
and §7.6 reads the result.

## §6.7 What we committed not to do

The plan closes with the commitments that give the rest of it force.
After data collection began, the model in (6.1′), the regime bins, the
conditions, and the items were not to change for any confirmatory
analysis. No analysis would be run to rescue a non-confirmatory result
and then reported as confirmatory. No items would be re-binned and no
thresholds moved after the primary result was seen. No subset of models
or items would be selected to recover an effect. Any post-collection
observation worth pursuing would be reported as exploratory and labeled
as such. These are the promises that make a confirmation in §7 mean
something, and the deviations in §5.6 are disclosed precisely because
the promises were made.

# Chapter 7: Results

Ask a capable language model a question that has no answer, and most of
the time it will tell you so. Across the seven models we tested, a
direct request for an answer to one of the FEH-79 Knightian items (a
forecast with no base rate, a dilemma with no dominant option, a coined
entity that appears nowhere in the training corpus) drew a correct
answer (“*this cannot be determined”)* about three-quarters of the time.
Then instruct the same models, on the same items, to reason step by
step. They begin to build. One inference licenses the next; a plausible
consideration hardens into a premise; the premise narrows the field; and
a few sentences later, the model has reasoned its way to a confident,
specific answer to a question that admits none. The rate of correct
abstention falls. In the model where it falls hardest, qwen2.5:14b, it
drops by nearly forty points.

That behavior is the prediction of Theorem 2.6.1 made visible in a
transcript: past the truncation point $k^{*}$, each additional inference
step does not refine the estimate, it manufactures one. The theoretical
chapters argued that under meta-uncertainty, the expected free energy of
$k$-cue inference turns upward, so that more deliberation should *cost*
accuracy rather than buy it. The regime is not a laboratory artifact. It
is the situation of a clinician facing a presentation the literature
does not cover and being asked, all the same, for an answer. This
chapter reports what happened when we put that prediction to a
pre-registered test across seven models and 7,875 trials.

The prediction held. The pre-registered interaction coefficient
$\beta_{3}$ of the primary model (eq. 6.1′) is negative with posterior
probability $1.0000$, and the implied high-regime accuracy drop is
large: a posterior-median $17.3$ percentage points. Both arms of the
§6.2 decision gate are cleared, so $H_{1}$ is **confirmed**. The effect
is not universal, and the honest version of the result is more
interesting than the headline: instructed reasoning hurts some models
badly, barely touches others, and is absent-to-reversed in the two
weakest. The rest of
this chapter lays out the findings and their boundaries in the order a
skeptic would want them.

## §7.1 Data collected

The full design ran to completion: seven models, forty-five items, five
length-graded conditions, five replications each. That is 7,875 model
responses, and every one of them returned a usable answer, with no
generation failures and no empty cells anywhere in the grid. The panel
divides into the five open-weight local models (phi3.5,
mistral:7b-instruct, qwen2.5 at 7B, 14B, and 32B) and the two frontier
API models (claude-sonnet-4-5, gpt-4o); each contributed exactly 1,125
responses. The five conditions are balanced at 1,575 responses apiece.
The items were split into 31 high-regime Knightian frames, scored for
correct recognition of indeterminacy, and 14 low-regime controls, scored
against a known answer key: 5,425 high-regime responses and 2,450
low-regime responses in all. The procedure that produced these cells,
and the three places where the executed study departs from the letter of
the pre-registration, are documented in §5; the deviations are logged in
§5.6 and revisited where they bear on a specific result below.

## §7.2 The signature

Begin with the raw cell means, before any model is fit. Figure 7.1 plots
accuracy against condition for the two regimes. The two lines tell the
whole story at a glance, and they tell opposite stories.

In the high-meta-uncertainty regime, accuracy falls as the assigned
reasoning length grows. Direct-answer prompting (C1) yields correct
recognition of indeterminacy on $77.1\%$ of trials. Each successive
condition asks for more deliberation, and each returns a lower number:
$66.5\%$ at C2, $64.7\%$ at C3, $64.4\%$ at C4, $62.1\%$ at C5. The
descent is monotone. Pooling the four instructed-reasoning conditions
against the direct baseline, the high-regime accuracy drop is $12.7$
percentage points.

In the low-regime control items, the same manipulation has almost no
effect. Accuracy sits near $0.82$ across the board ($83.7\%$ direct, and
a pooled instructed-reasoning mean within two points of it), with no
downward trend; if anything, C5 is the strongest control condition of
the five. The low-regime short-to-long drop is $1.73$ percentage points,
which is to say, noise.

The difference between those two drops is the descriptive heart of the
paper. It is the difference-in-differences: $12.7$ points lost in the
high regime against $1.73$ lost in the low regime, for a raw DiD of
$10.97$ percentage points (Figure 7.2). Telling a model to think harder
does not, in general, lower its accuracy. It lowers accuracy where the
question is genuinely undetermined and leaves it alone where the
question has an answer. That selectivity is the fingerprint the
framework predicted, and it is present in the data before any Bayesian
machinery touches it.

## §7.3 The primary test

The descriptive signature could, in principle, be an artifact of which
items landed in which bin, or of one model dominating the average. The
pre-registered analysis exists to rule that out. Eq. 6.1′ is a
hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression with the assigned-length
factor `long`, the regime indicator, their interaction, and random
intercepts and length-slopes for every model and item. Because `long` is
binary, its interaction coefficient $\beta_{3}$ is exactly the
difference-in-differences on the log-odds scale, now estimated with all
the heterogeneity modeled rather than averaged away.

The posterior is unambiguous. The interaction is negative with posterior
probability $Pr(\beta_{3} < 0 \mid \text{data}) = 1.0000$; not a single
posterior draw placed the high-regime length effect on the helpful side
of zero. The posterior median is $\beta_{3} = - 0.692$. The low-regime
length slope is small and slightly negative ($\beta_{1} = - 0.183$), so
instructed reasoning carries a faint generic cost even on well-defined
items, but the high-regime penalty is roughly four times larger; the
probability that the high-regime effect strictly exceeds the low-regime
effect in magnitude (the full-reversal condition of the original v0.2
statistic) is $0.905$.

The §6.2 gate does not run on the log-odds coefficient directly. It runs
on the *robust implied accuracy drop*: the high-regime short-to-long
change in predicted accuracy, evaluated at the empirical high-regime
base rate and depending only on the posterior of
$(\beta_{1} + \beta_{3})$, which sidesteps the weakly identified global
intercept. That estimand has a posterior median of $17.3$ percentage
points, with a 95% credible interval of $\lbrack 7.7,25.5\rbrack$. The
model-based estimate runs higher than the raw $12.7$-point descriptive
drop because the regression recovers the within-condition effect after
absorbing item and model variance that flattens the raw average.

Both pre-registered requirements are therefore comfortably met. The
directional gate asked for $Pr(\beta_{3} < 0) > 0.95$ and received
$1.0000$. The magnitude gate asked for a posterior-median robust drop
above $6$ points and received $17.3$, with the entire credible interval
clear of the threshold. By the rule fixed in §7.1 of the
pre-registration before any data was seen, $H_{1}$ is confirmed (Figure
7.3).

## §7.4 Where the effect lives, and where it doesn’t

A single posterior probability of $1.0000$ invites the wrong picture: a
uniform law, every model degrading in lockstep. That is not what the
data show. The pooled interaction is decisive because the hierarchical
model borrows strength across the panel, and the random-slope structure
of eq. 6.1′ exists precisely so the average does not stand in for the
members. Pre-registered check R5 refits the primary model on each
model’s data alone. Figure 7.4 shows the per-model interaction
$\beta_{3}$ with its credible interval. The spread is wide.

The Qwen family carries the degradation — qwen2.5:32b returns
$\beta_{3} = - 2.92$ (95% CrI $\lbrack - 4.05, - 1.81\rbrack$),
qwen2.5:7b $- 2.86$ $\lbrack - 3.81, - 1.94\rbrack$, and qwen2.5:14b
$- 2.23$ $\lbrack - 3.29, - 1.17\rbrack$ — each places its entire
credible interval below zero, at $Pr(\beta_{3} < 0) = 1.000$. The two
frontier models point the same way without clearing the bar on their own
— gpt-4o at $\beta_{3} = - 0.89$ $\lbrack - 2.15, + 0.39\rbrack$ and
claude-sonnet-4-5 at $- 0.80$ $\lbrack - 2.09, + 0.48\rbrack$ are
directionally negative with posterior probabilities of $0.913$ and
$0.884$, which suggests (rather than establishes) that this phenomenon
takes place when each is read in isolation. The two weakest models do
not show the penalty. phi3.5 returns $\beta_{3} = + 0.98$
$\lbrack + 0.19, + 1.79\rbrack$, $Pr(\beta_{3} < 0) = 0.009$ (on phi3.5
the instruction to reason measurably helps). mistral:7b-instruct sits at
$+ 0.52$ with an interval straddling zero. These coefficients are
unpooled, one fit per model, so they run larger in magnitude than the
single panel-average $\beta_{3} = - 0.69$ of §7.3, which holds one fixed
interaction across all seven systems; the per-model fits let each
model’s interaction find its own level.

The modeled estimate corrects a distortion in the raw
difference-in-differences. By the descriptive DiD, qwen2.5:14b was the
most affected model, and the Qwen ordering ran 14B, 7B, 32B; the modeled
$\beta_{3}$ reorders them 32B, 7B, 14B, because the cell-mean contrast
is inflated by control-arm movement that the hierarchical model absorbs.
Two of the Qwen models posted control accuracies that *rose* under
instructed reasoning, and phi3.5’s control block fell by more than
twenty points. Hence, the descriptive DiD credited those models for
movement in the denominator rather than the numerator. The within-model
interaction, estimated with item variance modelled, is the cleaner read
and is the one reported in Figure 7.4; the descriptive per-model DiD is
retained in the supplement.

The honest summary is therefore narrower than “reasoning degrades LLMs,”
and more defensible for being narrow. On properly constructed Knightian
items, instructed reasoning degrades the capable mid-to-large models
decisively across the Qwen family and directionally in the two frontier
models. In comparison, the two weakest models, which sit on the
small-model recognition floor, do not show it and, in phi3.5’s case, run
the other way. The pooled confirmation is real because it pools; the
per-model picture shows the effect is carried by the capable models,
which is exactly where the o1/o3 reasoning-scaling narrative stakes its
claim.

This heterogeneity is not a blemish on the confirmation; it is the
texture the theory anticipates. The truncation point $k^{*}$ depends on
how much meta-uncertainty a model carries into the item, and there is no
reason to expect that quantity to be constant across architectures and
scales. What the pre-registered test establishes is that, pooled across
the panel with heterogeneity modeled, the regime-dependent penalty is
real and large. What Figure 7.4 establishes is that one should not sell
it as a universal law.

## §7.5 The realized-steps reversal, and why it does not threaten the result

The pre-registration’s original v0.2 model regressed accuracy on the
*realized* number of reasoning steps a model produced, not on the length
condition it was assigned. Amendment 2 demoted that model to a secondary
analysis (R7) and promoted the assigned-length factor to primary, on the
ground that realized step count is endogenous. The confirmatory data
make the reason for that amendment concrete, because the two models
disagree in sign.

Fit on realized steps, the interaction reverses: $\beta_{3} = + 0.416$
with a 95% credible interval of $\lbrack 0.271,0.560\rbrack$ and
$Pr(\beta_{3} < 0) = 0.000$. Read naively, that says longer reasoning
*helps* in the high regime, the opposite of the primary finding. The
naive reading is wrong, and it is wrong for a reason the design foresaw.
Realized step count is not assigned; it is chosen by the model in the
course of answering, and it is entangled with the difficulty of the
particular attempt. A trace that runs long because the model is
floundering, and a trace that runs long because the model is working
carefully, both enter the realized-steps regressor as “more steps.”
Within a fixed assigned condition, the items a model handles well are
not a random subset of the items it sees more steps on. Conditioning on
a post-treatment variable that the treatment itself moves is a textbook
way to induce a spurious association, and the sign flip is its
signature.

The assigned-length factor has none of this trouble because it is fixed
by random assignment before the model writes a word. That is why the
pre-registration gates $H_{1}$ on the assigned-length interaction and
reports the realized-steps interaction as a mechanistic companion, not a
test. We flag the reversal here in the open rather than leaving a
reviewer to find it: the two numbers point opposite ways, the primary
one is the causal estimand, and the secondary one is exactly the
confound that motivated the switch.

Two further analyses settle the question the reversal raises. The
instrumented form of R7 uses the assigned condition as an instrument for
the realized step count, recovering the per-step effect while purging
the endogeneity that contaminates the naive fit. Instrumented, the
high-regime per-step interaction is $- 0.53$ (95% CrI
$\lbrack - 0.86, - 0.20\rbrack$, $Pr < 0 = 0.999$). Once the realized
count is instrumented, its variation is driven solely by random
assignment; more reasoning then lowers accuracy in the high regime,
consistent with the primary model and in contrast to the naive fit. And the naive fit is not even stable to how a
step is counted. Re-segmenting reasoning by paragraph rather than
sentence (robustness check R1) flips the realized-steps interaction back
to negative, $\beta_{3} = - 0.39$ $\lbrack - 0.54, - 0.25\rbrack$. An
estimand whose sign turns on the segmentation rule is not one on which a
hypothesis should rest. The assigned-length primary makes that case
structurally rather than by assertion (Figure 7.5).

## §7.6 The controls did their job

The low-regime control block is not a sideshow; it is the within-study
evidence that the high-regime degradation is about the regime and not
about the manipulation. The fourteen control items carry well-defined
answers (arithmetic with a correct result, aleatory questions with a
calculable rate), and they were run through the identical five-condition
length ladder. If instructed reasoning degraded accuracy because longer
outputs are simply riskier, or because the scorer penalizes verbose
answers, the controls would fall too. They do not. The control accuracy
holds near $0.82$ across all five conditions, with a short-to-long drop
of $1.73$ points that is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

That flat control line discharges the most obvious alternative
explanations as a group: the degradation is not a generic length
penalty, not a scoring artifact tied to output verbosity, and not a
property of the prompt templates, since the templates are shared across
regimes. What remains is the regime itself. The three pre-registered
confound analyses of §6.6 (the prompt-sensitivity baseline, the
aleatory-specific control, and the per-model calibration baseline) are
addressed descriptively by this control block; the full per-signature
analyses are not yet computed and will be reported in supplementary
material.

## §7.7 Robustness checks

The pre-registration commits to a battery of robustness checks that
probe whether the primary result survives reasonable changes to the
analysis. They do not gate the confirmatory inference; they test its
conditional invariance. Four of the seven have now been run on the
confirmatory data, and they are reported here whatever they show; three
remain, and are named as outstanding rather than quietly dropped.

Three of the four point the same way as the primary. The per-model refit
(R5) is read in §7.4: the interaction is negative in five of seven
models and decisive in the three Qwen systems. The
paragraph-segmentation refit (R1) and the instrumented realized-steps
analysis (R7) are read in §7.5; both return negative interactions, and
R1 in particular testifies against the realized-steps regressor rather
than against the primary.

The one check that pushes back deserves to be stated first and plainly.
R6 adds an item-level random slope on the length factor, the maximal
random-effects specification, so that each item carries its own length
effect and the fixed interaction must survive once that heterogeneity is
absorbed. Under R6 the interaction stays negative at the median,
$\beta_{3} = - 0.47$, but its credible interval widens to
$\lbrack - 1.03, + 0.15\rbrack$ and the directional posterior falls to
$Pr(\beta_{3} < 0) = 0.935$, below the $0.95$ bar the gate uses. The
registered model, fixed before the data, carries an item random
intercept and no item random slope, so the confirmation in §7.3 is
untouched by definition; the verdict stands on the model that was
registered. But R6 was pre-registered too, and what it shows is real:
with item-to-item variation in the length effect modeled, the effect
holds its direction while its certainty slips past the threshold. The
honest reading is that the degradation is robust in sign and somewhat
sensitive in magnitude to how item heterogeneity is partitioned, a
sensitivity a 45-item panel should be expected to carry.

Three checks cannot be run on this dataset, and the reason is worth
stating exactly. The tercile and continuous-score binning (R2), the
calibration-component-dropped variant (R3), and the
held-out-calibration-item subset (R4) all operate on the continuous §3.2
regime score, whose calibration-error component requires a per-item
confidence elicitation the confirmatory protocol did not collect. The
study used category assignment instead, which rests not on a post-hoc
score but on the construction-time Knightian-ness criteria of §4: the
high-regime items are the ones that passed the K2 cross-model
disagreement screen and the K3 indexed-corpus floor. The
regime-score-versus-category alignment check that would convert §5.6’s
“coincide by construction” from argument to measurement needs the same
uncollected input. None of the three bears on the confirmatory gate,
which runs on the assigned-length factor; all are scoped to a follow-up
study that collects the confidence data, and §8.5 carries the
limitation.

## §7.8 Convergence and the sampler deviation

One departure from the pre-registered analysis bears reporting in full,
because it touches the convergence criterion the pre-registration names
explicitly. The registered sampler was four chains of 2,000 warm-up and
2,000 draws at a target acceptance of $0.95$. At those settings one
parameter missed the registered $\widehat{R} < 1.01$ threshold: the
high-regime intercept $b_{2}$, at $\widehat{R} = 1.0128$. The
interaction coefficient that carries $H_{1}$ was never the problem:
$\beta_{3}$ returned $\widehat{R} = 1.0004$ with an effective sample
size near 4,000 at the registered settings. To clear the gate for every
parameter rather than report a result the pre-registration’s own
convergence rule would flag, the official fit lengthens the chains to
4,000 warm-up and 4,000 draws at a target acceptance of $0.99$. This is
a post-hoc increase in sampling effort, not a change to the model, the
data, the regressor, the priors, or the decision rule.

At the official settings the fit converges cleanly:
${\widehat{R}}_{\max} = 1.0056$ across all monitored parameters and a
minimum effective sample size of $1,692$, both inside the registered
bounds. The verdict is identical to the registered-sampler verdict to
three decimal places. The longer chain bought convergence on a nuisance
intercept; it changed nothing about the conclusion. We note the increase
as a deviation per §9.4 of the pre-registration.

## §7.9 Summary

The paper's load-bearing test returned a positive result. Under genuine
uncertainty about the answer (the Knightian regime the FEH-79 items were
built to create), instructing a language model to reason at greater
length lowers its accuracy by a pre-registered estimate of $17.3$
percentage points, with a posterior probability of $1.0000$ that the
effect runs in the predicted direction. The same instruction, applied to
matched control items with definite answers, costs nothing. The
dissociation is exactly the one predicted by Theorem 2.6.1, and it
clears the decision gate that was fixed before the data existed.

Several honesties travel with the headline. The effect is not uniform
across the panel: it is decisive in the three Qwen models, directional
but not individually conclusive in the two frontier models, and reversed
in phi3.5 while inconclusive in Mistral, so the defensible claim is
regime-dependent degradation carried by capable models, not a universal
penalty. The realized-steps analysis reverses sign, exactly as an
endogenous post-treatment regressor should, which is why the causal
weight rests on the randomly assigned length factor; instrumented, the
per-step effect returns to the predicted negative. One pre-registered
robustness variant, a maximal item-level random slope, holds the
effect’s direction but lets its directional posterior fall just below
the registered threshold, a sensitivity §7.7 reports in full. And the
convergence gate was met only after lengthening the sampler, a deviation
we log rather than bury. None of these weakens the confirmation; each
one sharpens what the confirmation is allowed to claim.

What the result licenses, and what it does not, is the subject of §8.

# Chapter 8: Discussion

The prediction that organizes this paper is uncomfortable: that on the
questions that matter most, the ones without a settled answer, teaching
a model to think harder makes it worse. §7 reports that the prediction
held (cleanly) on seven models and 7,875 trials and held only where the
theory said it should. This chapter takes the measure of that result. It
says what the confirmation licenses, what it does not, and where the
framework is exposed.

## §8.1 Summary

The paper makes five linked contributions, and the empirical one is no
longer a promise. (i) A theoretical result (Theorem 2.6.1; Theorem
2.7.4) shows that fast-and-frugal heuristics, long defended on
ecological-rationality grounds and long suspected on
Bayesian-approximation grounds, are both at once: under meta-uncertainty
over prior precision, the expected free energy of $k$-cue inference is
U-shaped in $k$, and its minimum slides toward fewer cues as the
variance of the meta-precision prior grows. The thirty-year
Bayesian-versus-heuristic debate dissolves into a regime-dependent
equivalence: under precise priors, heuristics approximate the Bayesian
answer; under imprecise priors, they are the answer.

(ii) An operationalization (§3) turns the theoretical regime indicator
     into measurable quantities, exposing the regime score as an
     interaction hypothesis rather than a main effect. (iii) The FEH-79
     benchmark (§4) is built under three falsifiable Knightian-ness
     criteria, so that any item can be challenged on evidence rather
     than taste. (iv) The pre-registered study (§5–§7) was run and its
     hypothesis confirmed: the assigned-length interaction $\beta_{3}$
     is negative with posterior probability $1.0000$ and an implied
     high-regime accuracy drop of $17.3$ points, clearing a decision
     gate fixed before the data existed. (v) The framework stands as a
     counter-narrative to the contemporary assumption that
     inference-time compute is a free dial, an assumption that the
     confirmed result directly contradicts on properly constructed
     uncertainty tasks.

## §8.2 The theoretical resolution and its scope

The Bayesian-versus-heuristic debate lasted thirty years because both
sides were partly right. The theorem in §2.6 makes the dividing
condition explicit: $k^{*} = K$, full inference, is optimal when
$\sigma_{\tau}^{2} < \tau_{\text{regime}}$; $k^{*} < K$, truncation, is
optimal otherwise. The two camps were each generalizing from a different
regime. The contribution is not to crown a winner but to give the regime
indicator a closed-form characterization and show that it separates
empirically.

The scope claim is narrow, and the confirmation does not widen it. The
theorem holds in the Gaussian-Gamma sequential-inference setting of §2,
with appendix-level extension to a binary toy model, and it does not
generalize automatically to all heuristics, all priors, or all task
structures. The empirical work tests a specific operational prediction,
the §6 $H_{1}$. The §7 confirmation narrows the framework’s plausibility
without proving the general theorem. The asymmetry is worth stating
plainly: a positive result, which we have, raises the framework’s
credibility; a negative result would have falsified the operational
prediction without touching the theoretical claim, provided a confound
was found in the operationalization or the benchmark. We committed in
advance to treating the pre-registered test as load-bearing, and we hold
to that. It carried.

## §8.3 What the empirical commitments buy

Three commitments separate this work from comparable critiques of LLM
reasoning. The Knightian-ness criteria make benchmark construction
falsifiable: any FEH-79 item can be challenged by showing that it admits
a base rate, that it draws unanimous substantive cross-model agreement
under multi-seed validation, or that it appears in indexed corpora. The
hierarchical Bayesian analysis with its pre-registered gate, a
directional posterior above $0.95$ joined to a robust accuracy drop
above six points, forecloses the inflated-significance artifacts that a
45-item by 5-condition panel could otherwise manufacture. And the
control items close off the obvious alternative readings: §7.6 shows
that the degradation does not affect well-defined, matched questions, so
it is not a generic penalty for longer output or an artifact of the
scorer.

What these commitments buy is a result a skeptic can trust without
trusting the authors. The pre-registration is the binding contract, and
§5.6 discloses every place the executed run drew outside its lines.

## §8.4 An unexpected internal consistency check

One finding from building the benchmark warrants discussion, as the
framework did not anticipate it. During the pool’s v0.2-to-v0.3
development, several candidate items showed modal-answer flipping across
independent seeds at temperature 0.7: an item that single-shot
validation called disagreement, and that re-screening called
unanimous-substantive, or the reverse. K1-005, an asset-class macro
forecast, anchored hard on one narrative under multi-seed and split
across narratives in earlier single-shot runs; K4-003, a five-firm
data-sharing dilemma, alternated between a dominant withhold answer and
a balanced spread.

That cross-seed instability is the same signal, $\sigma_{b}$ in the §3.2
notation, that the regime score is built to detect. Items that flip
across seeds carry high $\sigma_{b}$ at the construction stage, which is
the Knightian signature the §7 analysis tests for at the condition
stage. The K2 multi-seed pre-screen is, in effect, the §3 regime-score
detector run while the benchmark is being built rather than while the
experiment is being run. The operationalization (§3) and the benchmark
protocol (§4), designed independently, converge on one diagnostic. This
was not built in; it surfaced from the work of making the pool, and it
suggests the multi-seed protocol may generalize as a
benchmark-construction primitive in its own right.

## §8.5 Limitations

The confirmation comes with boundaries, and the most important one is
visible in the data itself.

**The effect is not universal.** §7.4 is unambiguous: the degradation is
large in the Qwen family, directional but inconclusive in the two
frontier models, and reversed in phi3.5, with Mistral inconclusive. The
pooled posterior is decisive, but the per-model picture forbids the
headline “reasoning degrades LLMs.” The defensible claim is narrower: on
properly constructed Knightian items, instructed reasoning degrades
capable models that sit off the small-model recognition floor, and how
far it degrades them varies by architecture and scale, as the truncation
point $k^{*}$ should. A reader who wants universal law will not find one
here, and should not.

**The panel does not include reasoning-specialized models.** The seven
models span 3B to frontier scale, but none is an o1, o3, or R1-style
system trained to spend test-time compute. The confirmed effect lives in
capable models that were not built to reason at length; whether it
survives, worsens, or is engineered away in other models is the single
most consequential open question, and §8.6 treats it as the next study,
not a claim this one can make.

**The regime was operationalized by category rather than by the
continuous score.** Regime was assigned by item category, Knightian
versus control, rather than by the registered continuous regime score
binned at its quartiles (§5.6). The assignment is not unfounded: the
high-regime items passed the §4 construction criteria, the K2
cross-model disagreement screen and the K3 indexed-corpus floor, which
is direct evidence that they inhabit the regime. What is missing is a
measurement of the continuous score on these items, and the gap is
precise. The score’s calibration-error component is what separates
genuine meta-uncertainty from ordinary aleatory variance, and it is
exactly the aleatory controls, built to carry answer variance without
meta-uncertainty, that such a component is needed to classify; the
confirmatory run did not elicit the confidence judgments that component
requires. The continuous-score robustness checks (R2–R4) and the
score-versus-category alignment are therefore deferred to a study that
collects confidence, not run and quietly omitted here. The high-regime
outcome was also machine-checked recognition of indeterminacy rather
than the registered expert-coherence rating, with the 46 expert-panel
items deferred; the confirmation speaks to the auto-scorable Knightian
frames, not the full pool.

**The mechanistic story is partly open.** The realized-steps analysis
reverses sign (§7.5), the expected behavior of an endogenous
post-treatment regressor and the reason the causal weight rests on
assigned length. Instrumenting realized steps with the assigned
condition recovers a negative per-step effect, and paragraph-level
segmentation does the same, so the reversal is a property of the naive
regressor rather than evidence against the effect; what remains open is
a fully structural account of how realized reasoning mediates the
degradation. Four of the seven pre-registered robustness checks are run
(§7.7), and one of them, the maximal item-slope variant, lets the
directional posterior slip just below the gate while holding the sign;
the three checks that depend on the continuous regime score, together
with the regime-score-versus-category alignment, are owed to the
supplement.

**Knightian-ness is panel-relative and time-stamped.** The K2 criterion
is defined against a specific provider panel and at a specific date. As
frontier models train on this kind of item, an item’s K2 status can
change, so the FEH-79 pool is a dated probe rather than a permanent
benchmark.

## §8.6 Future work

The confirmation sharpens the research agenda more than it closes it,
and one study comes first. The paper argues against the prevailing view
that scaling test-time reasoning is reliably beneficial — yet it tested
that view on general-purpose models, not on the reasoning-specialized
systems (o1, o3, DeepSeek-R1, and their successors) the view is really
about. The priority, then, is to run those models through the identical
protocol and ask whether deliberately scaled inference incurs the same
regime-dependent accuracy cost we found here, or whether their training
has learned to suppress it on questions that admit no determinate
answer. That is the most direct possible test of the paper's claim, run
against exactly the systems the claim concerns.

Beyond it sit four lines. Precision-routed heuristic agents, which
estimate their own regime score and conditionally engage in shorter or
longer reasoning, turn the finding into a design principle. The open
theoretical questions of §2.10, mean-field accuracy (Q1), alternative
meta-precision priors (Q2), finite-$k$ corrections (Q3), and
non-Gaussian extensions (Q5), remain, with Q7 extending the Theorem
2.7.4 identity to a richer toolbox. A cross-domain replication on a
matched human panel would test whether the regime prediction is
species-general or specific to language models. And the deferred
expert-coherence study would carry the result from the 31 auto-scorable
frames to the full Knightian pool. Nearer at hand, the regime-score
robustness checks complete the analysis this paper began.

## §8.7 Positioning and conclusion

The framework is offered against the operating assumption of
contemporary AI development that inference-time compute is a free dial,
that more reasoning is neutral at worst and helpful at best. Theorem
2.6.1 says that under genuine uncertainty about prior precision, which
is the human decision-maker’s situation in nearly every consequential
domain, more reasoning is systematically harmful. The empirical claim
was that language models inherit the same regime structure, and §7
confirmed it: more instructed reasoning, lower accuracy, on exactly the
items where the answer cannot be settled, and nowhere else.

Because the test was pre-registered and confirmed, three consequences
follow with more than rhetorical force. The design default for systems
facing genuinely novel decisions should shift from inference-scaling
toward precision-routing, engaging long deliberation only where the
regime warrants it. Benchmark selection bias should be corrected by
including K1/K2/K3-validated Knightian probes alongside the
well-defined-task suites that dominate evaluation today. And the field
should expect, and reward, demonstrations of graceful degradation under
test-time compute on properly constructed uncertainty tasks, not merely
the absence of degradation.

The result earns those consequences, but only at the scope §7.4 allows.
The degradation is real, large, and pre-registered, and it is not a
universal law: it bites capable models hard and spares, or even helps,
the weakest, and it has not yet been measured on reasoning-specialized
models that would settle the matter. That is the honest shape of the
finding. The opposite outcome was equally available before the data came
in, which is what lets this one count: had $\beta_{3}$ landed on the
other side of zero, the counter-narrative would have been wrong as posed
and the framework a curiosity about a regime that language models do not
inhabit. It did not land there. The paper does not ask the reader to
take a side in the old debate. It asks the reader to commit to a regime
indicator, run the test, and update, which is what we did.

# Appendix A.1 — Binary Toy Model Proofs

This appendix provides the proofs deferred from §2.1, together with numerical verification. Two formal results are established:

- **Lemma A.1.2** (corrected statement of chapter Lemma 2.1.2): the *expected* meta-divergence is non-decreasing in the number of cues integrated. The chapter's sample-wise statement is incorrect; a counterexample is exhibited below.
- **Proposition A.1.4** (corrected statement of chapter Proposition 2.1.3): the EFE-minimizing policy admits *three* qualitative regimes — `k*=0`, `k*=1`, and `k*=K` — separated by two critical concentrations `κ_lo(v_seq, μ_0)` and `κ_hi(v_seq, μ_0)`. The "one-cue stopping" regime is a narrow band, not the dominant one. A precise statement and numerical characterization follow.

A subsidiary result, **Lemma A.1.1**, gives the closed-form posterior on `p_0` after `k` cues — a 2-component Beta mixture whose components are independent of `k` and whose mixture weights move with the cue history.

The corrections to the chapter wording are tracked at the end of the appendix.

---

## A.1.1 Setup recap

Latent state `s ∈ {0,1}`. Prior: `P(s=1 | p_0) = p_0`. Hyperprior: `p_0 ~ Beta(α_0, β_0)`, with prior mean `μ_0 = α_0/(α_0 + β_0)` and concentration `κ_0 = α_0 + β_0`. Binary cues `c_j ∈ {0,1}` with cue validities `v_j ∈ (1/2, 1)` and a symmetric error model:

$$
P(c_j = 1 \mid s = 1) = v_j, \qquad P(c_j = 0 \mid s = 0) = v_j.
$$

Define the cue-product likelihoods after `k` cues:

$$
\pi_1(c_{1:k}) = \prod_{j=1}^{k} v_j^{c_j}(1-v_j)^{1-c_j}, \qquad
\pi_0(c_{1:k}) = \prod_{j=1}^{k} v_j^{1-c_j}(1-v_j)^{c_j}.
$$

These are the conditional probabilities of the observed cue sequence under `s=1` and `s=0` respectively, derived from cue conditional independence given `s`.

---

## A.1.2 Lemma A.1.1 — Closed-form posterior on p_0

**Lemma A.1.1.** *For any cue sequence `c_{1:k}`, the variational posterior on `p_0` is a 2-component mixture of Beta distributions whose components depend on `(α_0, β_0)` but not on `k` or on the cue history:*

$$
p(p_0 \mid c_{1:k}) = w_1(c_{1:k}) \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0;\, \alpha_0+1,\, \beta_0) \;+\; w_0(c_{1:k}) \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0;\, \alpha_0,\, \beta_0+1)
$$

*with mixture weights*

$$
w_1(c_{1:k}) = \frac{\pi_1(c_{1:k}) \, \mu_0}{Z(c_{1:k})}, \qquad
w_0(c_{1:k}) = \frac{\pi_0(c_{1:k}) (1-\mu_0)}{Z(c_{1:k})},
$$

*where `Z(c_{1:k}) = π_1 μ_0 + π_0 (1 - μ_0)` is the marginal cue likelihood. The prior decomposes in the same form with weights `(μ_0, 1-μ_0)`.*

**Proof.** The unnormalized posterior is

$$
p(p_0 \mid c_{1:k}) \propto \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0, \beta_0) \cdot \big[\,p_0 \pi_1 + (1-p_0)\pi_0\,\big].
$$

Using the identities

$$
p_0 \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \mu_0 \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0+1, \beta_0),
$$

$$
(1-p_0) \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0, \beta_0) = (1-\mu_0) \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0, \beta_0+1),
$$

(both verified by direct computation using `Γ(α_0+1) = α_0 Γ(α_0)`), the unnormalized posterior becomes

$$
\pi_1 \mu_0 \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0+1, \beta_0) + \pi_0 (1-\mu_0) \cdot \mathrm{Beta}(p_0; \alpha_0, \beta_0+1).
$$

The normalizing constant is `Z = π_1 μ_0 + π_0 (1-μ_0)`, and division gives the stated form. The prior corresponds to `π_1 = π_0 = 1`, yielding `(w_1, w_0) = (μ_0, 1-μ_0)` and reducing to the algebraic identity `Beta(α_0, β_0) = μ_0 \cdot Beta(α_0+1, β_0) + (1-μ_0) \cdot Beta(α_0, β_0+1)`. ∎

**Consequence for P(s=1 | c_{1:k}).** By direct application of Bayes' theorem with `s` marginalized over `p_0`:

$$
P(s = 1 \mid c_{1:k}) = \frac{P(c_{1:k} \mid s=1) \, P(s=1)}{P(c_{1:k})} = \frac{\pi_1 \mu_0}{Z(c_{1:k})} = w_1(c_{1:k}).
$$

The marginal posterior on the state is exactly the mixture weight on the upper Beta component. This is a clean result that simplifies all downstream computation.

---

## A.1.3 Lemma A.1.2 — Expected meta-divergence is non-decreasing

**Lemma A.1.2 (corrected statement of chapter Lemma 2.1.2).** *The expected meta-divergence `E_{c_{1:k}}[Δ_meta(k)]` is non-decreasing in `k`. Equivalently, the marginal expected meta-cost*

$$
E[\Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k+1) - \Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k)] \;=\; I(p_0;\, c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}) \;\geq\; 0,
$$

*with equality iff cue `k+1` carries no conditional information about `p_0` given the prior cues.*

**Proof.** By the tower property of conditional expectation,

$$
E_{c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}}\big[\, p(p_0 \mid c_{1:k+1}) \,\big] = p(p_0 \mid c_{1:k}).
$$

By joint convexity of KL divergence in its first argument, Jensen's inequality gives

$$
E_{c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}}\big[\, \mathrm{KL}[p(p_0 \mid c_{1:k+1}) \,\|\, p(p_0)] \,\big] \;\geq\; \mathrm{KL}\!\left[\, E_{c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}}[p(p_0 \mid c_{1:k+1})] \,\Big\|\, p(p_0) \,\right].
$$

The right-hand side equals `KL[p(p_0 | c_{1:k}) || p(p_0)] = Δ_meta(k)`. Taking outer expectation over `c_{1:k}` preserves the inequality. The equality condition follows from the martingale-convexity formulation: equality holds iff `p(p_0 | c_{1:k+1}) = p(p_0 | c_{1:k})` almost surely under the predictive distribution, which is the condition that cue `k+1` carries no conditional information about `p_0`. ∎

**Counterexample to the chapter's sample-wise claim.** With `α_0 = β_0 = 1` (uniform hyperprior) and validities `v = (0.9, 0.9)`, direct computation of `Δ_meta(k; c_{1:k})` for the four cue paths gives:

| `c_1` | `c_2` | `Δ_meta(1; c_1)` | `Δ_meta(2; c_1, c_2)` | sample monotone? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0.1153 | 0.1815 | yes |
| 0 | 1 | 0.1153 | **0.0000** | **no** |
| 1 | 0 | 0.1153 | **0.0000** | **no** |
| 1 | 1 | 0.1153 | 0.1815 | yes |

When opposite cues cancel (paths `01` and `10`), the posterior on `p_0` returns exactly to the prior and the meta-divergence collapses to zero. The chapter's wording — "Δ_meta(k) is non-decreasing in k" — is therefore false sample-wise. The expectation across the four paths is monotone, as Lemma A.1.2 establishes.

**Implication for the chapter.** The wording in §2.1 should be changed from "the meta-divergence Δ_meta(k) is non-decreasing in k" to "the expected meta-divergence E[Δ_meta(k)] is non-decreasing in k." The downstream proofs in §2.5 already work with expected free energy (which is itself an expectation over cues), so no other proofs are affected.

---

## A.1.4 Proposition A.1.3 — Marginal benefit of cue k+1

Define the marginal benefit of cue `k+1` as the expected reduction in expected free energy:

$$
\Delta G(k+1) \;\equiv\; E[G(a, k)] - E[G(a, k+1)] \;=\; I(s;\, c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}) - I(p_0;\, c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}).
$$

**Proposition A.1.3.** *In the binary toy model, the marginal benefit of cue `k+1` decomposes as the difference of two conditional mutual informations: the information cue `k+1` provides about the latent state `s` (positive contribution to EFE reduction) minus the information it provides about the prior precision parameter `p_0` (positive contribution to meta-divergence).*

**Proof.** From eqs (2.5.2)–(2.5.4) of the chapter, the expected free energy after `k` cues decomposes as `E[G(a,k)] = -E[\log p(o|s,a)] - I(s; c_{1:k}) + E[Δ_meta(k)]`. The first term is action-dependent but `k`-independent; it cancels in `ΔG(k+1)`. The second term gives `I(s; c_{1:k+1}) - I(s; c_{1:k}) = I(s; c_{k+1} | c_{1:k})` by chain rule for mutual information. The third term gives `E[Δ_meta(k+1) - Δ_meta(k)] = I(p_0; c_{k+1} | c_{1:k})` by Lemma A.1.2 and the same chain rule applied to KL. ∎

**Consequence.** Cue `k+1` should be integrated iff `I(s; c_{k+1} | c_{1:k}) > I(p_0; c_{k+1} | c_{1:k})` — i.e., it is more informative about the state than about the meta-precision. The optimal `k*` is the smallest `k` such that this inequality is violated for `c_{k+1}`.

---

## A.1.5 Proposition A.1.4 — Three-regime structure

Numerical sweep of the binary toy model across `(κ_0, μ_0, v_{1:K})` reveals that the EFE-minimizing policy has three qualitative regimes, separated by two critical concentrations.

**Proposition A.1.4 (corrected statement of chapter Proposition 2.1.3).** *Fix a validity profile `v_{1:K}` and prior mean `μ_0`. There exist critical concentrations `0 < κ_lo(v_{1:K}, μ_0) ≤ κ_hi(v_{1:K}, μ_0)` such that the EFE-minimizing policy `k*(κ_0)` has the structure:*

- *(Don't-observe regime) `κ_0 < κ_lo`: `k* = 0`. The meta-divergence cost of even one cue exceeds its information value about `s`. The agent should act on the prior.*
- *(One-cue stopping regime) `κ_lo ≤ κ_0 ≤ κ_hi`: `k* = 1`. The first cue is integrated; subsequent cues incur higher meta-cost than information benefit. This is the take-the-best stopping rule.*
- *(Full integration regime) `κ_0 > κ_hi`: `k* = K`. Each cue contributes more state-information than meta-cost; the agent integrates all available cues.*

*The intermediate regime `[κ_lo, κ_hi]` is a closed interval that may be narrow (and in some validity profiles degenerate to a single point, in which case the transition jumps directly from `k*=0` to `k*=K`).*

**Numerical characterization.** A systematic search over `v_{1:K} ∈ (0.5, 1)^K`, `μ_0 ∈ {0.3, 0.5, 0.7}`, and `κ_0 ∈ [0.1, 200]` (geometric grid) finds:

- *Sharp validity gradients yield wider one-cue regimes.* Profiles with `v_1 ≈ 0.99` and `v_{j>1} ≤ 0.55` exhibit `[κ_lo, κ_hi]` of nontrivial width, often near `κ_0 ≈ 1`.
- *Uniform validity profiles tend to have `κ_lo = κ_hi`.* The transition then jumps directly from `k*=0` to `k*=K`, and the one-cue regime is degenerate.
- *Realistic decreasing-validity profiles (the TTB-typical case) lie in between.* The one-cue regime exists but is narrow; the qualitative behavior is dominated by the don't-observe / full-integration dichotomy.

The narrowness of the one-cue regime in the binary toy model is a substantive finding: in the discrete binary setting under symmetric error and conditional independence of cues given `s`, the cue-truncation theorem fires generically only at the **boundary** between two qualitatively different regimes, not as a wide intermediate regime. This is in contrast to the continuous Gaussian-Gamma case (Theorem 2.6.1, §2.6), where the one-cue regime widens because per-cue meta-cost grows linearly in `k` rather than saturating after the first cue.

**Subsidiary observation: TTB is near-optimal even when not strictly optimal.** A separate computation shows that for steep validity profiles (`v_1 ≈ 0.99, v_{j>1} ≤ 0.55`), the *first cue* contributes ≥99% of the total attainable information about `s` across the full cue budget `K`. Even in regimes where `k* = K` strictly minimizes EFE, the marginal contribution of cues `2..K` is so small that a TTB-style "stop after the first cue" policy is near-optimal in expected reward terms. This near-optimality is the empirically-relevant content of the TTB connection in the binary setting; the strict EFE-optimality in the narrow `[κ_lo, κ_hi]` window is the formally-derivable but operationally-fragile content.

**Implication for §2.7.** The structural-equivalence argument in §2.7 (Theorem 2.7.1) is the load-bearing claim. The binary toy model serves as motivating intuition and a lower-dimensional sanity check, not as a strict existence proof for the one-cue regime. The chapter's claim that "the cue-truncation point `k*` is generically finite and often equal to one in the binary case" should be hedged: it is *attainable* in the binary case under specific conditions, but is not the dominant regime. The continuous Gaussian-Gamma model is where the cue-truncation theorem fires robustly across a wide regime of meta-uncertainty.

---

## A.1.6 Numerical verification

All numerical results in this appendix are produced by `binary_toy_monte_carlo.py` and `binary_toy_kstar_search.py`, which compute expected free energy by exhaustive enumeration over cue paths (tractable up to `K = 10`). The KL divergence between the posterior and prior 2-component Beta mixtures is computed by numerical integration on a 2000-point grid over `(0, 1)`. Verification of Lemma A.1.2 across five validity profiles and four hyperprior configurations: monotone in expectation across all 5 cases. Verification of Proposition A.1.4 across 25 × 5 × 5 × 3 = 1875 parameter combinations: 40 combinations exhibit `k* = 1` strictly; the remainder split between `k* = 0` and `k* = K`. The transition curve plots are reproducible from the scripts.

---

## A.1.7 Summary of corrections to the v0.4 chapter

The following amendments to §2.1 are recommended on the basis of this appendix:

1. **Lemma 2.1.2 wording.** Change "the meta-divergence `Δ_meta(k)` is non-decreasing in `k`" to "the expected meta-divergence `E[Δ_meta(k)]` is non-decreasing in `k`." Add a one-sentence note about the sample-wise counterexample with reference to this appendix.

2. **Proposition 2.1.3 wording.** Replace the current single-regime statement ("the EFE-minimizing policy stops at the first discriminating cue") with the three-regime statement of Proposition A.1.4. Hedge the TTB connection: in the binary case, the one-cue regime is narrow; the cleaner TTB derivation lives in §2.7 via the Gaussian-Gamma machinery.

3. **§2.1 closing paragraph.** The sentence "the binary toy model is sufficient to motivate the FEH effect and to establish the take-the-best connection in its most natural setting" should be softened to "the binary toy model motivates the FEH effect; the strict cue-truncation regime is more robust in the continuous Gaussian-Gamma model of §§2.3–2.6, which is the load-bearing setting for the chapter's main results."

These changes weaken §2.1's strong claims and strengthen the chapter's overall honesty. They do not affect the core results in §§2.4–2.7, which derive from the Gaussian-Gamma machinery rather than the binary case.

# Appendix A.2 — Proof of Lemma 2.4.1 (monotonicity of meta-precision divergence)

This appendix proves the monotonicity of the meta-precision divergence in the Gaussian-Gamma generative model of §§2.2–2.4 (v0.4). The proof parallels the binary case of Appendix A.1: the expectation-form statement is true and admits a clean proof via martingale-convexity of KL; the sample-wise statement is false in general and a counterexample is given.

## A.2.1 Setup

From the v0.4 chapter:

- Generative model (eq 2.2.1–2.2.2):
$$
p(s \mid \tau) = \mathcal{N}(s; \mu, \tau^{-1}\Sigma_0), \qquad
p(c_j \mid s, \tau, \gamma_j) = \mathcal{N}(c_j; A_j s, (\tau\gamma_j)^{-1} I_{d_c}),
$$
with hyperprior `p(τ) = Gamma(α_0, β_0)`.

- Variational posterior under mean-field `q(s, τ) = q(s)q(τ)` and standard VBEM (eq 2.4.3):
$$
q(\tau \mid c_{1:k}) = \mathrm{Gamma}\!\left(\alpha_k,\, \beta_k\right), \qquad
\alpha_k = \alpha_0' + \tfrac{k}{2}, \qquad
\beta_k = \beta_0' + \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{k} \gamma_j M_j,
$$
where `α_0' = α_0 + 1/2`, `β_0' = β_0 + V_s/2`, and `M_j = E_{q(s)}[(c_j - A_j s)^T(c_j - A_j s)]`. The `M_j` depend on the cue realizations through their effect on `q(s)`.

- Meta-precision divergence (eq 2.4.5):
$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k) \;\equiv\; \mathrm{KL}\!\big[\,q(\tau \mid c_{1:k}) \;\big\|\; p(\tau)\,\big]
$$
which has the closed form
$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k) = (\alpha_k - \alpha_0)\psi(\alpha_k) - \log\!\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_k)}{\Gamma(\alpha_0)} + \alpha_0 \log\!\frac{\beta_k}{\beta_0} + \alpha_k\frac{\beta_0 - \beta_k}{\beta_k}.
$$

The meta-cost increment of the `(k+1)`-th cue is `C(k+1) ≡ Δ_meta(k+1) - Δ_meta(k)`. Both `Δ_meta(k)` and `C(k)` are random variables depending on the cue history `c_{1:k}` through the `M_j`.

## A.2.2 Lemma A.2.1 — Sample-wise monotonicity is false in general

**Lemma A.2.1.** *Δ_meta(k) is not monotone in `k` along arbitrary realized cue paths in the Gaussian-Gamma model.*

**Numerical evidence.** Across 1000 IID samples of `M_j ~ Exp(1)` for `K = 20`, with `(α_0', β_0') = (2, 1)` and `γ_j = 1`, **979 sample paths exhibit at least one strict decrease** of Δ_meta along the trajectory.

**Why this happens.** Under the conjugate update, both `α_k` and `β_k` increase monotonically — `α` by exactly `1/2` per cue (deterministic) and `β` by `γ_j M_j / 2` per cue (random, non-negative). However, the Gamma KL is *not* monotone in `(α, β)` along arbitrary trajectories: increasing `β` while `α` is fixed shifts the posterior mean `α/β` *away* from the prior mean `α_0/β_0`, but increasing `α` while `β` is fixed shifts it *toward* the prior mean (since posterior mean grows). When a particular `M_j` realization is large enough that `β_k/α_k` overshoots `β_0/α_0`, subsequent cues with smaller `M_j` can pull `β_k/α_k` back, decreasing the KL.

**Consequence.** The chapter's wording in v0.3 — "Δ_meta(k) is non-decreasing in k, with strict increase whenever the k-th cue is non-degenerate" — is sample-wise false. The wording must be restated in expectation form. (This parallels the binary-case correction in Appendix A.1.)

## A.2.3 Lemma A.2.2 — Expected meta-divergence is non-decreasing (corrected Lemma 2.4.1)

**Lemma A.2.2 (corrected statement of chapter Lemma 2.4.1).** *Under the generative model (2.2.1)–(2.2.2) with mean-field factorization (2.4.1), the expected meta-precision divergence `E[Δ_meta(k)]` is non-decreasing in `k`. Equivalently,*
$$
E[\Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k+1)] - E[\Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k)] \;=\; I(\tau;\, c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}) \;\geq\; 0,
$$
*with equality iff cue `k+1` carries no conditional information about `τ` given the prior cues `c_{1:k}`.*

**Proof.** By the tower property of conditional expectation applied to the variational posterior,
$$
E_{c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}}\big[\, q(\tau \mid c_{1:k+1}) \,\big] \;=\; q(\tau \mid c_{1:k}).
$$
By joint convexity of KL divergence in its first argument, Jensen's inequality gives
$$
E_{c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}}\big[\, \mathrm{KL}[q(\tau \mid c_{1:k+1}) \,\|\, p(\tau)] \,\big]
\;\geq\;
\mathrm{KL}\!\left[\, E_{c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}}[q(\tau \mid c_{1:k+1})] \,\Big\|\, p(\tau) \,\right]
\;=\; \Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k).
$$
Taking outer expectation over `c_{1:k}` preserves the inequality and yields `E[Δ_meta(k+1)] ≥ E[Δ_meta(k)]`. The mutual-information identity follows from the chain rule for KL: `E[Δ_meta(k+1)] - E[Δ_meta(k)] = I(τ; c_{k+1} | c_{1:k})`. Equality holds iff the conditional posterior `q(τ | c_{1:k+1})` equals `q(τ | c_{1:k})` almost surely under the predictive distribution of `c_{k+1} | c_{1:k}`. ∎

**Numerical verification.** Across five test cases spanning low-to-extreme meta-uncertainty (`α_0' ∈ {0.5, 1, 2, 5, 20}`), `E[Δ_meta(k)]` is strictly non-decreasing with `k`, verified by Monte Carlo with 5000 samples per case and `K = 30` cues.

## A.2.4 Note on the proof's reliance on the variational posterior

The proof uses only the tower property — that `E[q(τ | c_{1:k+1}) | c_{1:k}] = q(τ | c_{1:k})` — and Jensen's inequality for KL. The tower property holds for any *consistent* sequential Bayesian update, which the standard VBEM iteration produces. Higher-order corrections to the mean-field approximation (the structured-variational direction of open question Q1) preserve consistency and therefore preserve Lemma A.2.2; only the magnitude of `E[Δ_meta(k)]` may change. That magnitude change is itself quantified exactly for the conjugate model in §A.2.5 (Proposition A.2.3).

## A.2.5 Mean-field accuracy: exact comparison in the conjugate model (resolves Q1)

Open question Q1 (§2.10) asks how much the mean-field factorization `q(s, τ) = q(s)q(τ)` distorts the meta-precision posterior relative to a structured family. In the Gaussian-Gamma model of §2.2 the question admits an exact answer, because the model is fully conjugate: the joint posterior `p(s, τ | c_{1:k})` is Normal-Gamma in closed form, so the mean-field posterior can be compared against the *truth* rather than against another approximation. (For a non-conjugate generative model no exact joint is available and a structured variational family is the appropriate object; the result below is specific to the conjugate model used to prove Theorems 2.6.1 and 2.7.1.)

**Setup (scalar case, `d_s = d_c = 1`).** After `k` cues with `c_j = s + noise` (`A_j = 1`) and intrinsic precisions `γ_j`, write `Λ_k = λ_0 + Σ_{j≤k} γ_j` and the precision-weighted mean `m_k = (λ_0 μ_0 + Σ_{j≤k} γ_j c_j)/Λ_k`. The **exact** marginal posterior over `τ` is `Gamma(α_k, β_k^ex)` with
$$
\alpha_k = \alpha_0 + \tfrac{1+k}{2} = \alpha_0' + \tfrac{k}{2}, \qquad
\beta_k^{\mathrm{ex}} = \beta_0 + \tfrac12\big[\, \lambda_0 \mu_0^2 + \textstyle\sum_{j\le k} \gamma_j c_j^2 - \Lambda_k m_k^2 \,\big].
$$
The **mean-field** VBEM fixed point is `q(s) = N(m_k, S_k)`, `q(τ) = Gamma(α_k, β_k^mf)`, with `S_k = 1/(⟨τ⟩ Λ_k)`, `⟨τ⟩ = α_k/β_k^mf`, and
$$
\beta_k^{\mathrm{mf}} = \beta_0 + \tfrac12\, E_{q(s)}\!\big[\, \lambda_0 (s-\mu_0)^2 + \textstyle\sum_{j\le k} \gamma_j (c_j - s)^2 \,\big].
$$
The exact and mean-field posteriors carry the *same* shape `α_k`: the shape counts data dimensions, not their values.

**Proposition A.2.3 (mean-field rate inflation).** *In the conjugate Gaussian-Gamma model the mean-field and exact marginal posteriors over `τ` are both `Gamma(α_k, ·)` with the common shape `α_k = α_0' + k/2`, and their rates are related exactly by*
$$
\beta_k^{\mathrm{mf}} = \beta_k^{\mathrm{ex}} \cdot \frac{\alpha_k}{\alpha_k - \tfrac12}.
$$
*Equivalently the relative rate error is `(β_k^mf − β_k^ex)/β_k^ex = 1/(2α_k − 1)`, maximal at the first cue and decreasing monotonically as `k` grows (and as `α_0` grows).*

**Proof.** Expanding the mean-field rate with `E_{q(s)}[(x − s)^2] = (x − m_k)^2 + S_k`,
$$
\beta_k^{\mathrm{mf}} = \beta_0 + \tfrac12\big[\, \lambda_0\big((m_k-\mu_0)^2 + S_k\big) + \textstyle\sum_{j\le k} \gamma_j\big((c_j - m_k)^2 + S_k\big) \,\big].
$$
Because `m_k` is the precision-weighted mean, the data-dependent quadratics satisfy the identity
$$
\lambda_0 (m_k-\mu_0)^2 + \textstyle\sum_{j\le k} \gamma_j (c_j - m_k)^2 \;=\; \lambda_0 \mu_0^2 + \textstyle\sum_{j\le k} \gamma_j c_j^2 - \Lambda_k m_k^2,
$$
which is exactly twice the bracket in `β_k^ex`; and the variance terms sum to `(λ_0 + Σ γ_j) S_k = Λ_k S_k`. Hence
$$
\beta_k^{\mathrm{mf}} = \beta_k^{\mathrm{ex}} + \tfrac12 \Lambda_k S_k = \beta_k^{\mathrm{ex}} + \frac{1}{2\langle\tau\rangle} = \beta_k^{\mathrm{ex}} + \frac{\beta_k^{\mathrm{mf}}}{2\alpha_k},
$$
using `S_k = 1/(⟨τ⟩ Λ_k)` and `⟨τ⟩ = α_k/β_k^mf`. Solving the fixed-point equation, `β_k^mf(1 − 1/(2α_k)) = β_k^ex`, i.e. `β_k^mf = β_k^ex · α_k/(α_k − ½)`. ∎

**Remark (under-estimation of posterior precision and variance).** Since the shape is shared, `⟨τ⟩^mf = α_k/β_k^mf = (α_k − ½)/β_k^ex = (1 − 1/(2α_k))·⟨τ⟩^ex` and `Var^mf(τ) = (1 − 1/(2α_k))^2 · Var^ex(τ)`. Mean-field under-estimates both the posterior mean and the posterior variance of the meta-precision, by a factor vanishing as `α_k → ∞` — the expected behaviour when a coupling (here `s`–`τ`) is severed.

**Consequence for `Δ_meta` and `k*`.** Because the shape is identical, the entire mean-field error in `Δ_meta(k) = KL[q(τ | c_{1:k}) ‖ p(τ)]` is the rate shift of Proposition A.2.3. Numerically (`verify_meanfield_and_tau_regime.py`, Parts 0 and A; the closed form is confirmed to `3×10^{-13}` against the iterated VBEM fixed point), across the meta-uncertainty grid:

| Regime | `α_0'` | `σ²_τ` | `k*_exact` | `k*_MF` | rate err `@k=1` | rate err `@k*` | `C̄(k*)` rel err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low | 20 | 0.05 | 29 | 29 | 2.5% | 1.5% | 1.1% |
| Medium | 5 | 0.20 | 24 | 24 | 10.0% | 3.0% | 0.6% |
| High | 2 | 0.50 | 23 | 23 | 25.0% | 3.9% | 0.7% |
| Very high | 1 | 1.00 | 22 | 22 | 50.0% | 4.4% | 0.1% |
| Extreme | 0.7 | 1.43 | 22 | 22 | 71.4% | 4.5% | 0.1% |

The mean-field error in `E[Δ_meta(k)]` is an under-estimate, concentrated at the first cue (≈16% in the high-meta regime, falling below 2% by `k ≈ 5`). Crucially the EFE-optimal stopping point `k* = argmin E[G(k)]` is **identical** under the mean-field and exact posteriors in every regime: at the stopping point the rate error is below 5% and the marginal meta-cost `C̄(k*)` — the quantity the `argmin` actually turns on — is recovered to within ≈1%. Mean-field thus preserves the *exact location* of the optimal truncation; the residual is confined to an `O(1/α_k)` bias in the magnitude of the meta-cost. This answers the quantitative half of Q1.

**Multivariate note.** For state dimension `d_s > 1` the constant `½` in Proposition A.2.3 becomes `d_s/2` and `Λ_k` a matrix, but the structure is unchanged: the shape is shared and the rate is inflated by `α_k/(α_k − d_s/2) → 1`. The chapter's analysis uses the scalar case, for which the result is exact as stated.

# Appendix A.3 — Proof of Theorem 2.6.1 (cue-truncation)

## A.3.1 Setup

From §2.5 (eqs 2.5.1–2.5.4), the expected free energy under the v0.4 model decomposes as
$$
G(a, k) \;=\; \underbrace{-E_q[\log p(o \mid s, a)]}_{\text{pragmatic}} \;+\; \underbrace{I(s;\, c_{1:k})}_{\text{epistemic}} \;+\; \underbrace{\Delta_{\mathrm{meta}}(k)}_{\text{meta-precision cost}}.
$$
The pragmatic term is `k`-independent (depends on the action distribution at decision time). The marginal benefit of the `(k+1)`-th cue, in expectation under the predictive distribution, is therefore
$$
E[\Delta G(k+1)] \;=\; E[G(a, k)] - E[G(a, k+1)] \;=\; I(s;\, c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}) - I(\tau;\, c_{k+1} \mid c_{1:k}).
$$
*Cue `k+1` is integrated under the EFE-optimal policy iff `E[ΔG(k+1)] > 0`.*

The optimal stopping rule is `k*(σ²_τ) = argmin_{k} E[G(a, k)]`, equivalent to the smallest `k` such that the conditional information about `s` from cue `k+1` no longer exceeds the conditional information about `τ`.

The threshold `τ_regime` is defined (eq 2.5.5) as
$$
\tau_{\mathrm{regime}} = \inf\{\,\sigma^2_\tau > 0 :\, k^*(\sigma^2_\tau) < K\,\}.
$$

## A.3.2 Theorem A.3.1 (corrected statement of chapter Theorem 2.6.1)

**Theorem A.3.1.** *Under the generative model (2.2.1)–(2.2.2) with mean-field factorization (2.4.1), with `K` available cues:*

*(a) **Low meta-uncertainty regime.** When `σ²_τ < τ_regime`, the expected free energy `E[G(a, k)]` is monotonically non-increasing in `k` for all `k ≤ K`. The EFE-optimal policy integrates all available cues: `k*(σ²_τ) = K`.*

*(b) **High meta-uncertainty regime.** When `σ²_τ ≥ τ_regime`, there exists a finite `k*(σ²_τ) < K` such that `E[G(a, k)]` is decreasing for `k ≤ k*` and non-decreasing for `k > k*`. The EFE-optimal policy is to integrate exactly `k*` cues.*

*(c) **Optimal cue ordering.** Among orderings of the `K` cues, the descending-cue-validity ordering greedily maximizes `E[ΔG(k)]` at each step `k ≤ k*`, provided cue intrinsic precisions `γ_j` satisfy a non-anticorrelation regularity condition with cue validities (formalized below).*

The theorem is restated in expectation form. The sample-wise version is false: across 1000 random parameter configurations, only 198 sample-wise `G(k)` trajectories are U-shaped; the rest exhibit multiple sign changes due to noise in individual cue realizations. Active inference defines the optimal policy as `argmin_k E[G(k)]`, so the expectation form is what the theorem must establish.

## A.3.3 Proof of (a) — Low meta-uncertainty regime

**Claim.** If `σ²_τ < τ_regime`, then `E[ΔG(k)] ≥ 0` for all `k = 1, ..., K`.

**Proof.** By Lemma A.2.2 and the chain rule for mutual information,
$$
E[\Delta G(k)] = I(s;\, c_k \mid c_{1:k-1}) - I(\tau;\, c_k \mid c_{1:k-1}).
$$
Both quantities are non-negative. By the data-processing inequality applied to the chain `τ → s → c_k`, the cue `c_k` carries information about `τ` only through `s`:
$$
I(\tau;\, c_k \mid c_{1:k-1}) \leq I(s;\, c_k \mid c_{1:k-1})
$$
in the limit `σ²_τ → 0` (where `τ` is essentially deterministic and observing `s` reveals the same about `τ` as observing nothing). For finite `σ²_τ`, the meta-information `I(τ; c_k | c_{1:k-1})` is bounded above by a quantity that vanishes as `σ²_τ → 0`. Specifically,
$$
I(\tau;\, c_k \mid c_{1:k-1}) \;=\; O(\sigma^2_\tau) \quad \text{as } \sigma^2_\tau \to 0,
$$
following from the leading-order expansion of the Gamma KL in `σ²_τ` (computed from the closed form in eq 2.4.5). Therefore for `σ²_τ` sufficiently small (i.e., below `τ_regime`), `E[ΔG(k)] > 0` for all `k`, and `E[G(a, k)]` is monotonically decreasing in `k`. ∎

## A.3.4 Proof of (b) — High meta-uncertainty regime

**Claim.** If `σ²_τ ≥ τ_regime`, then `E[G(a, k)]` is U-shaped in `k`, with a unique minimum at some finite `k*`.

**Proof.** Define the marginal expected info gain `Ī(k) = I(s; c_k | c_{1:k-1})` and the marginal expected meta-cost `C̄(k) = I(τ; c_k | c_{1:k-1})`. Then `E[ΔG(k)] = Ī(k) - C̄(k)`.

**Step 1: `Ī(k)` is monotonically non-increasing in `k`.** By the data-processing inequality applied to the conditional mutual information,
$$
I(s;\, c_k \mid c_{1:k-1}) \leq I(s;\, c_k),
$$
and conditioning on `c_{1:k-1}` weakly reduces remaining information about `s` available from `c_k` (since `s` becomes more determined). The standard "diminishing returns" property of Bayesian information gain applies: as `c_{1:k-1}` accumulate, `H(s | c_{1:k-1})` decreases, leaving less remaining information for `c_k` to provide.

**Step 2: `C̄(k)` is bounded below by a positive constant in the high-meta-uncertainty regime.** From eq 2.4.3, the rate parameter `β_k` grows linearly in `k` (in expectation, `E[β_k] = β_0' + (k/2) γ_bar m_bar` where `γ_bar`, `m_bar` are average cue intrinsic precision and prediction error). The expected marginal increment `C̄(k+1) = E[Δ_meta(k+1) - Δ_meta(k)]` is bounded below by `c_min(σ²_τ) > 0` for `σ²_τ ≥ τ_regime`. (The bound `c_min` is computable in closed form from the digamma derivative; details in Appendix A.4.)

**Step 3: `E[ΔG(k)]` changes sign exactly once.** By Steps 1 and 2, `Ī(k)` is monotonically decreasing and `C̄(k)` is bounded below. Therefore `E[ΔG(k)] = Ī(k) - C̄(k)` is monotonically decreasing (since `Ī(k+1) \leq Ī(k)` and `C̄(k+1) ≥ C̄(k)` in expectation, by Lemma A.2.2). The smallest `k` for which `E[ΔG(k+1)] \leq 0` is `k*`. By construction `k* < K` whenever `σ²_τ ≥ τ_regime`. The function `E[G(a, k)]` is therefore decreasing for `k ≤ k*` and non-decreasing for `k > k*`, i.e., U-shaped with minimum at `k*`. ∎

**Numerical verification.** Across five `(α_0', β_0', γ_bar, m_bar)` configurations spanning low-to-extreme meta-uncertainty, `E[G(a, k)]` is U-shaped with finite `k*` in every case. The trajectory of `k*` as `σ²_τ` increases:

| Regime | `α_0'` | `σ²_τ ~ 1/α_0'` | `k*` (out of K=30) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low | 20 | 0.05 | 30 (full integration) |
| Medium | 5 | 0.2 | 22 |
| High | 2 | 0.5 | 14 |
| Very high | 1 | 1.0 | 9 |
| Extreme | 0.5 | 2.0 | 5 |

`k*` drops monotonically as meta-uncertainty rises, exactly as Theorem A.3.1 predicts.

## A.3.5 Proof of (c) — Optimal cue ordering

**Claim.** The descending-cue-validity ordering greedily maximizes `E[ΔG(k)]` at each step `k ≤ k*`, under the regularity condition that cue intrinsic precisions `γ_j` are not strongly anti-correlated with cue validities `v_j`.

**Proof.** At step `k`, the agent selects which unused cue to integrate next. The marginal expected benefit of integrating cue `j` (where `j` ranges over unused cues) is
$$
E[\Delta G(k+1; \text{cue } j)] \;=\; I(s;\, c_j \mid c_{1:k}) - I(\tau;\, c_j \mid c_{1:k}).
$$

**Step 1: First term is monotone in `v_j`.** For symmetric cue likelihoods, the conditional mutual information `I(s; c_j | c_{1:k})` is monotonically increasing in cue validity `v_j` (higher validity yields more information about `s`). This is standard from the Bayesian information theory of binary classification.

**Step 2: Second term scales with `γ_j`.** From eq 2.4.3, integrating cue `j` increments `β_k` by `γ_j M_j / 2`. The marginal meta-cost contribution `I(τ; c_j | c_{1:k})` therefore scales (approximately, in leading order) with `γ_j`.

**Step 3: Greedy ordering by validity is optimal under non-anticorrelation.** Define the *cue selection score* `S_j ≡ I(s; c_j | c_{1:k}) - I(τ; c_j | c_{1:k})`. The descending-validity ordering selects cues by decreasing `v_j`. This maximizes the first term at each step. It also maximizes `S_j` provided the second term is approximately equal across cues (`γ_j` is approximately constant), or more weakly, provided `Cov(v_j, γ_j) ≥ 0`. Under this regularity condition, descending validity is greedily optimal.

When `Cov(v_j, γ_j) < 0` (high-validity cues have low intrinsic precision, or vice versa), the optimal ordering deviates from pure validity ordering and trades off `v_j` against `γ_j`. This case is empirically uncommon (cue validity and cue intrinsic precision are typically positively correlated — informative cues are also reliably measured), but warrants flagging for empirical work. ∎

**Operational consequence.** The cue-truncation theorem under v0.4 reduces to the take-the-best procedure (descending-validity selection, truncated stopping) under the regularity condition that cue intrinsic precisions are not anti-correlated with cue validities. This is the formal Gaussian-Gamma anchor of the structural-equivalence argument in §2.7.

---

## A.3.6 Summary of corrections to the v0.4 chapter

The following amendments to §§2.4–2.6 are recommended:

1. **Lemma 2.4.1 wording.** Restate in expectation form: "the expected meta-precision divergence `E[Δ_meta(k)]` is non-decreasing in `k`." Reference Appendix A.2 for proof and counterexample.

2. **Theorem 2.6.1 wording.** Restate in expectation form throughout: `E[G(a, k)]` is monotone (a) / U-shaped (b) / minimized by descending-validity ordering (c). Note that sample-wise versions are false in general.

3. **Theorem 2.6.1(c).** Add the regularity condition `Cov(v_j, γ_j) ≥ 0` (cue intrinsic precisions not anti-correlated with cue validities). State that this is empirically typical but warrants check in specific applications.

4. **Definition of `τ_regime`.** Tighten: `τ_regime` is the smallest `σ²_τ > 0` such that the marginal expected meta-cost `C̄(K) = I(τ; c_K | c_{1:K-1})` exceeds the marginal expected info gain `Ī(K) = I(s; c_K | c_{1:K-1})`. This is the operational definition. Its well-definedness — that the crossing function `g(σ²_τ) = C̄(K) − Ī(K)` is increasing in `σ²_τ` and so has a unique root, and that this root coincides with the `k* < K` characterization because `E[ΔG(k)]` is monotone-decreasing in `k` — is established in §2.5 ("Well-definedness of the threshold") and verified numerically in `verify_meanfield_and_tau_regime.py` (Part B): across a sweep of `σ²_τ` the two definitions agree to grid resolution and `g` exhibits a single sign change (`C̄(K)` monotone increasing up to Monte-Carlo error).

These changes parallel the §2.1 corrections from Appendix A.1 (sample-wise → in-expectation throughout). They do not affect the load-bearing structure of the chapter — only the rigor of how the load-bearing claims are stated.

# Appendix A.4 — Sufficient Conditions for Exact FFH–TTB Action Identity

This appendix resolves the open question Q6 (§2.10): under what conditions does the *structural* FFH–TTB equivalence of Theorem 2.7.1 upgrade to *exact, sample-wise* identity of the agents' action distributions?

The result: a single explicit condition on the cue-validity profile — the **Descending Dominance (DD)** condition — suffices. The meta-precision prior tail does not enter the sufficient condition; it determines only whether FFH is in the truncation regime at all (the precondition $\sigma_{\tau}^{2} \geq \tau_{\mathrm{regime}}$ of Theorem 2.6.1). This is a sharper resolution than Q6 anticipated.

## A.4.1 Setup and Notation

Consider a two-alternative comparative judgment between options $A$ and $B$. There are $K$ binary discriminating cues, indexed $j = 1, \ldots, K$, with realized signal $d_{j} \in \{-1, +1\}$: $d_{j} = +1$ means cue $j$ favors $A$, $d_{j} = -1$ favors $B$. We adopt Gigerenzer and Goldstein's (1996) convention that the cue set has already been filtered to those that discriminate between the alternatives; non-discriminating cues are excluded from the set rather than counted toward stopping.

Each cue $j$ has validity $v_{j} \in (1/2, 1)$ — the probability that the cue's signal correctly indicates the better option:

$$
P(d_{j} = +1 \mid s = A) = v_{j}, \qquad P(d_{j} = -1 \mid s = A) = 1 - v_{j},
$$

and symmetrically for $s = B$. Cues are conditionally independent given $s$. Define the **per-cue log-likelihood ratio**:

$$
L_{j} \;:=\; \log \frac{v_{j}}{1 - v_{j}} \;>\; 0 \qquad (\text{since } v_{j} > 1/2).
$$

The validities are ordered descending: $v_{(1)} \geq v_{(2)} \geq \ldots \geq v_{(K)}$ (equivalently $L_{(1)} \geq L_{(2)} \geq \ldots \geq L_{(K)}$). We adopt a uniform prior on the comparative state, $\mu_{0} := P(s = A) = 1/2$.

**The two agents.** Both observe the same cue realization $c = (d_{(1)}, \ldots, d_{(K)})$ and emit an action $a \in \{A, B\}$ identified with $\{+1, -1\}$.

- **Take-the-best (TTB)** stops at the first cue in descending-validity order and chooses by its sign:
$$
a_{\mathrm{TTB}}(c) \;=\; \mathrm{sign}(d_{(1)}).
$$

- **FFH** integrates cues up to the EFE-optimal truncation $k^{*}$ of Theorem 2.6.1 and chooses by the sign of the posterior log-odds. Under uniform prior:
$$
a_{\mathrm{FFH}}(c) \;=\; \mathrm{sign}\!\left( \sum_{j=1}^{k^{*}} L_{(j)}\, d_{(j)} \right).
$$

## A.4.2 The Descending Dominance Condition

> **Definition A.4.1 (Descending Dominance, DD).** The validity profile $(v_{(1)}, \ldots, v_{(K)})$ satisfies the **Descending Dominance** condition if for every $i \in \{1, \ldots, K-1\}$:
> $$
> L_{(i)} \;>\; \sum_{j=i+1}^{K} L_{(j)}. \tag{DD}
> $$

In words: each cue's log-LR strictly exceeds the sum of all weaker cues' log-LRs.

**Geometric-decay sufficient form.** A practical sufficient condition: if there exists $\rho \in (0, 1/2)$ such that $L_{(j+1)} \leq \rho \cdot L_{(j)}$ for all $j$, then (DD) holds. The bound follows from the geometric sum:
$$
\sum_{j=i+1}^{K} L_{(j)} \;\leq\; L_{(i)} \cdot \sum_{m=1}^{K-i} \rho^{m} \;<\; L_{(i)} \cdot \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \;\leq\; L_{(i)},
$$
the last inequality holding for $\rho < 1/2$. The geometric-decay form is convenient for empirical work because $\rho$ can be estimated from cue-validity statistics directly.

**Examples.** (i) $v = (0.95, 0.75, 0.60, 0.55)$: $L \approx (2.94, 1.10, 0.41, 0.20)$, slacks $L_{(i)} - \sum_{j>i} L_{(j)} \approx (1.24, 0.49, 0.21) > 0$ — DD holds. (ii) $v = (0.70, 0.70, 0.70)$: $L \approx (0.85, 0.85, 0.85)$, slack at $i=1$ is $-0.85 < 0$ — DD fails.

## A.4.3 Theorem 2.7.4: Sample-wise Action Identity

> **Theorem 2.7.4 (Exact sample-wise FFH–TTB action identity).** Assume:
>
> (i) The cue-validity profile satisfies the Descending Dominance condition (DD).
> (ii) The prior is uniform: $\mu_{0} = 1/2$.
> (iii) FFH operates with EFE-optimal truncation $k^{*} \geq 1$ from Theorem 2.6.1 (which holds whenever the cue set is non-empty and informative).
>
> Then for every cue realization $c = (d_{(1)}, \ldots, d_{(K)}) \in \{-1, +1\}^{K}$:
> $$
> a_{\mathrm{FFH}}(c) \;=\; a_{\mathrm{TTB}}(c).
> $$
> Consequently, the marginal action distributions of FFH and TTB coincide exactly:
> $$
> P_{\mathrm{FFH}}(a = A) \;=\; P_{\mathrm{TTB}}(a = A) \quad\text{and}\quad P_{\mathrm{FFH}}(a = B) \;=\; P_{\mathrm{TTB}}(a = B).
> $$

**Proof.** Fix a cue realization $c$. By definition,
$$
a_{\mathrm{TTB}}(c) = \mathrm{sign}(d_{(1)}), \qquad a_{\mathrm{FFH}}(c) = \mathrm{sign}\!\left( S(c) \right), \quad S(c) := \sum_{j=1}^{k^{*}} L_{(j)}\, d_{(j)}.
$$

Decompose the FFH sum into leading and trailing terms:
$$
S(c) \;=\; L_{(1)} d_{(1)} \;+\; R(c), \qquad R(c) := \sum_{j=2}^{k^{*}} L_{(j)} d_{(j)}.
$$

Bound the trailing term using $|d_{(j)}| = 1$ and (DD):
$$
|R(c)| \;\leq\; \sum_{j=2}^{k^{*}} L_{(j)} \;\leq\; \sum_{j=2}^{K} L_{(j)} \;<\; L_{(1)} = |L_{(1)} d_{(1)}|,
$$
where the strict inequality is exactly (DD) at $i = 1$ (the first instance of the condition), and the second-to-last inequality uses non-negativity of the omitted terms ($L_{(j)} > 0$ for all $j$). Therefore the leading term strictly dominates in absolute value:
$$
|L_{(1)} d_{(1)}| \;>\; |R(c)|,
$$
which forces $\mathrm{sign}(S(c)) = \mathrm{sign}(L_{(1)} d_{(1)}) = \mathrm{sign}(d_{(1)})$. Hence $a_{\mathrm{FFH}}(c) = a_{\mathrm{TTB}}(c)$.

The marginal distribution identity follows by integration over the cue-generating distribution of $c$ (which is identical for both agents since they observe the same cue realizations). $\blacksquare$

**Remark.** The argument uses only the first instance of (DD), at $i = 1$. The full (DD) (with the condition at every $i$) is what permits *adaptive* extensions where the first discriminating cue may appear later than position 1 — see §A.4.4. For the present setup (all cues discriminate), the $i=1$ inequality alone suffices.

## A.4.4 Corollary on the Meta-Precision Prior Tail (Q6 Resolution)

> **Corollary A.4.2.** The sufficient condition (DD) is purely a condition on the validity gradient. No condition on the meta-precision prior $p(\tau) = \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha_{0}, \beta_{0})$ is needed for exact action identity.

**Proof.** The truncation index $k^{*}$ is the only place the meta-precision prior enters the FFH action: through Theorem 2.6.1, $k^{*} = k^{*}(\sigma_{\tau}^{2})$ depends on the prior variance. The proof of Theorem 2.7.4 shows that the FFH action's sign is invariant to $k^{*}$ as long as $k^{*} \geq 1$. Therefore the meta-precision prior tail does not influence the action. $\blacksquare$

**Comment.** Q6 (§2.10) conjectured that exact identity "likely involves a relationship between the meta-precision prior tail and the validity gradient." Theorem 2.7.4 reveals that the meta-precision prior tail's role is confined to *whether* truncation occurs (selecting $k^{*}$); conditional on $k^{*} \geq 1$, only the validity gradient (DD) matters. This is a sharper resolution than anticipated and removes a coupling that earlier drafts hedged against.

## A.4.5 Sharpness: Counterexample Under (DD) Violation

The (DD) condition is essentially sharp. We exhibit a validity profile that violates (DD) and a cue realization for which $a_{\mathrm{FFH}} \neq a_{\mathrm{TTB}}$.

**Counterexample.** Let $K = 3$ with $v = (0.70, 0.70, 0.70)$, so $L = (0.847, 0.847, 0.847)$. (DD) at $i = 1$ fails: $L_{(1)} = 0.847 < L_{(2)} + L_{(3)} = 1.693$. Consider the cue path $c = (-1, +1, +1)$:

- $a_{\mathrm{TTB}}(c) = \mathrm{sign}(d_{(1)}) = -1$ (choose $B$).
- $a_{\mathrm{FFH}}(c) = \mathrm{sign}(L_{(1)} \cdot (-1) + L_{(2)} \cdot (+1) + L_{(3)} \cdot (+1)) = \mathrm{sign}(-0.847 + 0.847 + 0.847) = +1$ (choose $A$).

The two agents disagree. The symmetric path $c' = (+1, -1, -1)$ yields the dual disagreement. Under uniform cue-generating distributions, these mismatch events occur with positive probability.

> **Proposition A.4.3 (necessity of DD).** Suppose the cue-validity profile is *not* descending-dominant — i.e., there exists $i \in \{1, \ldots, K-1\}$ such that $L_{(i)} \leq \sum_{j=i+1}^{K} L_{(j)}$. Then there exists a cue realization $c$ and a truncation $k^{*} \leq K$ such that $a_{\mathrm{FFH}}(c) \neq a_{\mathrm{TTB}}(c)$.

**Proof sketch.** If (DD) fails at $i = 1$, the construction above generalizes: choose $c$ with $d_{(1)} = -1$ and $d_{(j)} = +1$ for $j = 2, \ldots, K$, and take $k^{*} = K$. Then $S(c) = -L_{(1)} + \sum_{j \geq 2} L_{(j)} \geq 0$, while $a_{\mathrm{TTB}} = -1$. If (DD) fails at some $i > 1$, conditional on $d_{(1)} = \ldots = d_{(i-1)} = +1$ being interpreted as TTB-decisive at position $i-1$... — this case requires the more general adaptive setup in which TTB stops at the first cue (filtered or not); for the present binary-discriminating model where all cues discriminate, the $i = 1$ case is the operative one and the counterexample above applies whenever (DD) fails. $\blacksquare$

**Remark on tightness.** The proposition shows (DD) is tight up to boundary cases (equality). Strict inequality in (DD) is what guarantees the absolute-value strict dominance in the proof of Theorem 2.7.4; when (DD) holds with equality at $i = 1$, the cumulative sum can equal zero on opposing-cue paths, producing a tie at the FFH side while TTB still emits a definite sign. Equality is therefore a measure-zero boundary case; (DD) as stated (strict) is both sufficient and essentially necessary.

## A.4.6 Numerical Verification

The companion script `verify_appendix_A4.py` performs three checks.

**Check 1 — (DD)-satisfying profiles.** For four hand-picked profiles ($K \in \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$) and all $k^{*} \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$, exhaustive enumeration over the $2^{K}$ cue realizations finds **0 mismatches** between $a_{\mathrm{FFH}}$ and $a_{\mathrm{TTB}}$ in every case.

**Check 2 — (DD)-violating profiles.** For three hand-picked profiles violating (DD), exhaustive enumeration finds the predicted nonzero mismatch count. For $v = (0.70, 0.70, 0.70)$: 2/8 cue paths produce $a_{\mathrm{FFH}} \neq a_{\mathrm{TTB}}$, exactly the symmetric pair $\{(-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1)\}$ as predicted analytically.

**Check 3 — random (DD)-satisfying profiles.** Generating 200 random (DD)-satisfying validity profiles via geometric construction ($K \in \{2, \ldots, 6\}$, decay ratio $\rho \in [0.05, 0.45]$), and exhaustively enumerating all cue realizations and $k^{*}$ values: **0 mismatches across 26,696 sample-wise comparisons**.

**Proof-mechanism check.** For the leading two examples, the script verifies $|L_{(1)}| > \sum_{j>1} |L_{(j)}|$ directly, confirming the absolute-value-dominance argument that drives the proof.

## A.4.7 Summary

The structural FFH–TTB equivalence of Theorem 2.7.1 upgrades to exact, sample-wise action identity under a single explicit condition on the cue-validity profile: Descending Dominance (DD). The condition is computable from validity statistics, admits a convenient geometric-decay sufficient form, is sharp (necessary up to boundary equality), and is independent of the meta-precision prior. This resolves Q6 of §2.10 with a cleaner result than originally anticipated: the conjectured meta-precision-tail/validity-gradient interaction reduces to a validity-gradient condition alone.

For empirical work, (DD) becomes a checkable property of any cue ecology: estimate $\{v_{j}\}$ from training data, sort descending, compute $L_{j} = \log(v_{j}/(1-v_{j}))$, and verify $L_{(i)} > \sum_{j>i} L_{(j)}$ at every $i$. Ecologies satisfying (DD) admit the strong claim "FFH and TTB are the same agent"; ecologies violating (DD) admit only the weaker structural-equivalence claim of Theorem 2.7.1.
